## Contribute to Magento Merchant Documentation

Share your knowledge with the community by contributing to Magento Documentation!
You can contribute by creating an issue or pull request (PR) on our [MerchDocs](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs) GitHub repository.

We welcome all types of contributions; from minor typo fixes to new topics.

Magento Documentation staff members review issues and pull requests on a regular basis. We do our best to address all issues as soon as possible, but working through the backlog takes time. We appreciate your patience.

## Contribute documentation

New to GitHub and open source contribution? We have easy ways to write and contribute without knowing how to code. Check the wiki starting with [Getting Started](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/wiki).

You have different options for [writing content](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/wiki/Writing-Content):

- [Write in GitHub](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/wiki/Writing-Content#write-in-github): Edit and add files through your GitHub account in a web browser.
- [Write like a Developer](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/wiki/Writing-Content#write-like-a-developer): Edit and add files in a text editor or integrated developer environment (IDE) on your local computer.

After writing content, [submit your work](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/wiki/Branches-to-PRs#submit-a-pull-request) as a Pull Request (PR).

**Tip!** If you are not sure where to start contributing, search for issues with the `help wanted` and `good first issue` labels. These are researched and ready to work!

## User Guide versions

Our repository currently publishes two versions of the Magento User Guide: 2.3.x and 2.4.x (current).

If you want to contribute new or updated content, make sure that you create your working branch from the correct production branch:

- 2.4.x - `master`
- 2.3.x - `2.3-production`

Use the same branch as the base when you submit the PR. If you indicate in your PR description that the content applies to both versions, one of our staff members will address any update that is needed for the other release after the merge of the submitted PR.

## Create a pull request

1. Create a pull request to `magento/merchdocs` from your fork.

   In general, you should use `master` as the base branch when creating a PR. If your contribution is related to a release that is in progress, use a version-specific integration branch.

1. Complete the pull request template.

   **We will close your pull request if you do not complete the template.**

1. After creating a pull request, a Magento Documentation staff member or Maintainer will review it and may ask you to make revisions.

   **We will close your pull request if you do not respond to feedback in two weeks.**

**Important!** You must submit a signed CLA before your PR can be merged.

## Review changes locally

_(Optional)_ To review your changes in HTML output, follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/blob/master/README.md) to build the documentation site locally using Jekyll.

## Report an issue and feedback

If you have feedback or find a typo or errors in Magento MerchDocs, you can either submit contributions with a pull request (as described above) or you can report it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/issues/new/choose) in the MerchDocs GitHub repository.

You must complete the issue template. We will close your issue if you fail to complete the template. Enter as much information as you can, including content corrections, steps to reproduce, command or code updates, or questions for clarifications.

**Note:** Check the existing [issues](https://github.com/magento/merchdocs/issues) on GitHub to see if someone has already reported the issue.
