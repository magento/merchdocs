The Staging Dashboard provides an overview of all active and upcoming campaigns. The format of the dashboard can be changed from a grid to a timeline. You can also use filters to find campaigns, customize the column layout, and save different views of the grid. For more information about the workspace controls, see [Admin Workspace]({% link stores/admin-workspace.md %}).
