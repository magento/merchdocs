title: Elements - Heading
---

Heading levels establish a hierarchy that organizes content, and helps search engines index each page. Use the _Heading_ content type in the [Page Builder workspace]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}) to add a text container with a heading level from H1 to H6 to the stage. Headings are formatted according to the style sheet that is associated with the current theme.

The [Content Heading]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}) field in the _Content_ section can be used to add an H1 heading to the top of the page. However, the field is a legacy from previous versions of Magento and is provided to support older content. Because this field does not take advantage of Page Builderâ€™s advanced features, we recommend that you leave the Content Heading field blank and use the Page Builder Heading content type to add headings of any level to the page.

The following example shows how the Content Heading and the Heading content type appear when formatted by the Luma theme.

You can drag a heading from the _Elements_ section of the Page Builder panel to a row, column, or tab set on the stage. The heading level and alignment can be controlled from the editor toolbar on the stage, or by using the _Settings_ ( ![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})) control.

1. In the editor, enter the heading text over the `Edit Heading Text` placeholder.

   By default, the heading text is assigned a level two (H2) heading type.

1. In the toolbar, choose the appropriate heading type between H1 and H6.

1. Change the alignment, if needed.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span> in the upper-right corner.

## Edit header settings

1. Hover over the heading container to display the toolbox and choose the _Settings_ (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})) icon.

1. Update the heading content (**Heading Type** and **Heading Text**) if needed.

   This is also available to update in the heading editor.

1. Update the _Advanced_ settings as needed.

   - Choose an **Alignment** to control the positioning of the heading within the parent container:

      |Default|Applies the alignment default setting that is specified in the style sheet of the current theme.
      |Left|Aligns the list along the left border of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.
      |Center|Aligns the list in the center of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.
      |Right|Aligns the block along the right border of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.

   - Set the **Border** style applied to all four sides of the heading container:

      |Default|Applies the default border style that is specified by the associated style sheet.
      |None|Does not provide any visible indication of the container borders.
      |Dotted|The container border appears as a dotted line.
      |Dashed|The container border appears as a dashed line.
      |Solid|The container border appears as a solid line.
      |Double|The container border appears as a double line.
      |Groove|The container border appears as a grooved line.
      |Ridge|The container border appears as a ridged line.
      |Inset|The container border appears as a inset line.
      |Outset|The container border appears as a outset line.

   - If you set a border style other than `None`, complete the border display options:

      - **Border Color** - Specify the color by choosing a swatch, clicking the color picker, or by entering a valid color name or equivalent hexadecimal value.

      - **Border Width** - Enter the number of pixels for the border line width.

      - **Border Radius** - Enter the number of pixels to define the size of the radius that is used to round each corner of the border.

   - (Optional) Specify the names of **CSS classes** from the current style sheet to apply to the container.

      Separate multiple class names with a space.

   - Enter values, in pixels, for the **Margins and Padding** to determine the outer margins and inner padding of the heading container.

      Enter the corresponding values in the diagram.

      |Margins|The amount of blank space that is applied to the outside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left
      |Padding|The amount of blank space that is applied to the inside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span> and return to the Page Builder workspace.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save</span> to save the page.

## Duplicate a heading

For a formatted heading with specific settings, it is more efficient to duplicate the heading, rather than start over with a new placeholder.

1. Hover over the heading container to display the toolbox and choose the _Duplicate_ (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-duplicate.png %})) icon.

   The duplicate appears just below the original.
