title: Adding New Blocks

Custom blocks of content can be created, and then added to any page, group of pages, or even to another block. For example, you might place an image slider in a block, and then place the block on the home page. The Blocks workspace uses the same [basic controls]({% link cms/pages-workspace.md %}) as the Pages workspace to help you find available blocks and perform routine maintenance. When the block is complete, you can use the [Widget]({% link cms/widget-static-block.md %}) tool to place it on specific page(s) in your store.

1. If you want to change the default enabled status of the new block, set **Enable Block** to `No`.

1. Assign a **Block Title** for internal reference.

1. Assign a unique **Identifier** for the block.

   Use all lowercase characters with underscores instead of spaces.

1. Select each **Store View** where you want the block to be available.

1. Add the content for the block using the displayed content tool set:

   - If [Page Builder]({% link cms/page-builder.md %}) is enabled, the content [workspace]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}) includes the Page Builder tools.

      For information about adding blocks with Page Builder, see [Tutorial 2: Blocks]({% link cms/page-builder-tutorial2-blocks.md %}).

   - Use the [editor]({% link cms/editor.md %}) to format text, create links, and add tables, images, video, and audio.

      If you prefer to work with HTML code, click <span class="btn">Show / Hide Editor</span>.
