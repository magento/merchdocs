title: Page Builder Workspace
---

When [Page Builder is enabled]({% link cms/page-builder-setup.md %}), the _Content_ section and content creation process are modified to take advantage of the advanced Page Builder tools for CMS [pages]({% link cms/page-add.md %}), [product]({% link catalog/product-content.md %}) and [category]({% link catalog/categories-content-settings.md %}) pages, [blocks]({% link cms/block-add.md %}), and [dynamic blocks]({% link cms/dynamic-blocks.md %}). This section includes a _Content Heading_ field, a preview of the content, and easy access to the full-screen Page Builder workspace.

## Content Heading

Because search engines look for level one (H1) headings, adding a level one heading is an easy way to ensure that the page is indexed correctly.

{:.bs-callout-info}
The _Content Heading_ field that appears at the top of the page is a legacy field that supports content that was created with earlier versions of Magento. It is not, however, part of Page Builder. The Content Heading is formatted as an H1 heading according to the style sheet that is associated with the current theme, and positioned just above the active content area that is defined by the Page Builder stage.

For the best control over the positioning and format of headings of all levels, we recommend that you leave the _Content Heading_ field empty, and use the Page Builder [Heading]({% link cms/page-builder-elements-heading.md %}) content type.

## Preview

When you expand the _Content_ section and there is existing content created with Page Builder, it displays a preview of the content as it would appear in a page. Click <span class="btn">Edit with Page Builder</span> or inside the content preview area to open the Page Builder workspace, where you can make any needed updates.

{:.bs-callout-info}
For the product and category forms, this content preview is enabled by default, but can be disabled. If performance suffers due to loading the preview, you can disable the preview in the [Content Management configuration]({% link configuration/general/content-management.md %}#advanced-content-tools) settings.

## Stage

When you open the Page Builder workspace from the preview, the stage is the primary work area where you can create and format content, and even make quick edits to live content. The stage is initially empty, providing the design surface where you can drag rows, columns, and tabs from the left panel.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Starting with Magento 2.4.1, content editing is now full-screen only for all areas controlled by Page Builder. This includes CMS pages, product and category pages, blocks, and dynamic blocks. Full-screen editing puts the focus on your content and provides a view that better matches the user experience on the storefront.

## Viewports

A _viewport_ is the visible area of a web page that a user sees. In full-screen design mode, the viewport buttons are displayed above the Page Builder stage to show you the content as the site user will see it on the storefront.

Page Builder also defines breakpoints for viewports. Breakpoints define minimum and maximum widths within which certain styles are applied. The Page Builder viewports provide the following content breakpoints:

- **Desktop breakpoint**—`min-width: 1024px`. This breakpoint applies styles defined for viewport widths that measure 1024px and wider.
- **Mobile breakpoints**—`max-width: 768px, min-width: 640px`. These breakpoints apply styles defined for viewport widths between 768px and 640px.

Page Builder viewports provide two features: **content previews** and **breakpoint settings**.

### Content previews

By default, Page Builder provides two viewport previews:

- **Desktop** — Displays the content preview without a predefined width. Desktop-defined styles (using breakpoint minimum width of 1024px) are still applied to the page. But the Desktop viewport width is defined by settings for container content types, like Rows. Selecting the Desktop viewport shows how your content will be styled on the storefront when the browser page width is 1024px and wider.
- **Mobile** — Displays the content preview at a predefined width of 768px. Unlike the Desktop viewport, the Mobile viewport does show your page content at a width of 768px, along with the styles defined for the breakpoint widths of 768px (max) and 640px (min).

The following examples show the Page Builder default responsive settings for product carousels displayed for these viewports:

![Mobile viewport preview]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-workspace-viewport-mobile.png %}){: .zoom}
_Mobile viewport preview, width: 768px_

### Breakpoint settings

The viewport buttons also provide the option to apply different breakpoint styles to content types based on the selected viewport. By default, Page Builder provides breakpoint settings for the _Minimum Height_ fields of Rows, Columns, Tabs, Tab Items, Banners, Sliders, and Slides. When you select the Mobile viewport, then open the editor for one of those content types, you can enter field values specific to the Mobile viewport breakpoints. Content type fields that allow specific breakpoint settings display an icon to the right of the field, similar to the following example for a Row:

![Icon indicator for breakpoint setting]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-workspace-viewport-field-breakpoint.png %}){: .zoom}

## Panel

The Page Builder panel is located to the left of the stage, and contains content types that can be dragged to the stage. A container that is specific to the content type then appears with a toolbox of options. Content types are organized in the panel as follows:

| [Layout]({% link cms/page-builder-layout.md %}) | Includes rows, columns, and tabs that can be used as containers for other content types. |
| [Elements]({% link cms/page-builder-elements.md %}) | Includes text, headings, buttons, dividers, and snippets of HTML code that can be dragged to the stage. |
| [Media]({% link cms/page-builder-media.md %}) | Includes images, video, banners, sliders, and Google Maps that can be dragged to the stage. |
| [Add Content]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content.md %}) | Adds existing blocks of static or dynamic content, and products from your catalog. |

## Toolbox

Each content container on the stage has a toolbox of options. The options vary by content type, but typically include Move, Settings, Hide/Show, Duplicate, and Remove.

### Show the toolbox

Hover over the container to display the toolbox and choose an option.
