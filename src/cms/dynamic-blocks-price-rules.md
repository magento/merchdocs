title: Dynamic Blocks in Price Rules
---

Any [dynamic block]({% link cms/dynamic-blocks.md %}) that you create can be associated with a promotion. To make the association, you must first create both the dynamic block and the [catalog price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %}) or [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}). The association can be made while working on a price rule or when working on a dynamic block.

**Important:** After you create this association, the dynamic block is displayed **only** when the rule fires. If the promotion is targeted to segment A, the block is displayed to segment A. If the promotion is not active, the block is not displayed.
