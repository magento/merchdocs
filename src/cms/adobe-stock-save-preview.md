title: Saving an Adobe Stock Image Preview
---

An image preview is a watermarked version of an Adobe Stock asset. Image previews are free and are a good way to experiment with different images before you decide to [purchase a license][stock-license] for specific images and use them on your production stores.

When you are ready to license an image, the new [Media Gallery]({% link cms/media-gallery.md %}) provides a direct integration with Adobe Stock, making it easy to license the image directly from the gallery page.

## Prerequisites

This feature requires the [Adobe Stock Integration][adobe-stock-integration] module and configuration.

## Save a preview image

1. [Access the Adobe Stock Search grid][access-search].

1. Click an image in the search grid in order to [view the image details][view-details].

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Preview</span>.

   This displays a prompt for you to specify a file name that is used to save the image to the [Media Storage][media-storage]. A default file name is provided, but you can customize the name to your preferences.

   ![Save Adobe Stock preview image]({% link cms/assets/adobe-stock-save-preview.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Save the preview image_

1. Click <span class="btn">Confirm</span>.

   The page redirects to the Media Storage and your saved preview is displayed.
