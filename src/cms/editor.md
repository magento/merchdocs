title: Using the Editor
---

The editor gives you the ability to enter and format while working in a _What You See Is What You Get_ (WYSIWYG) view of the content. If you prefer to work directly with the underlying HTMLÂ code, you can easily change modes. The editor can be used to create content for [pages]({% link cms/pages.md %}), [blocks]({% link cms/blocks.md %}), and [product descriptions]({% link catalog/product-content.md %}). When working on product detail, access the editor by clicking <span class="btn">Show / Hide Editor</span>.
