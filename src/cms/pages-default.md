title: Default Pages
---

The _Default Pages_ configuration determines the landing page that is associated with the [base URL]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}) and the corresponding home page. It also determines which page appears when a _Page Not Found_ error occurs, and if a [breadcrumb trail]({% link catalog/navigation-breadcrumb-trail.md %}) appears at the top of each page.

## Configure the default pages

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to  **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel under _General_, choose **Web**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the **Default Pages** section.

   ![]({% link images/images/config-general-web-default-pages.png %}){: .zoom}

   {: .field-table }
   |Field|[Scope]({% link configuration/scope.md %})|Description|
