Create rich, interactive content that is driven by logic from [price rules]({% link marketing/promotions.md %}) and [customer segments]({% link marketing/customer-segments.md %}). Existing [dynamic blocks]({% link cms/page-builder-add-dynamic-block.md %}) can be added directly to the Page Builder [stage]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}). For a detailed, step-by-step example for using dynamic blocks, see [Tutorial 2: Blocks]({% link cms/page-builder-tutorial2-blocks.md %}).

{:.bs-callout-info}
The _Banner_ option in the [Content menu]({% link cms/content-menu.md %}) was deprecated in 2.3.1 and removed in 2.4.0. Its functionality is replaced by Dynamic Blocks.

   _Choosing a customer segment_

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   - If no Segment is created, the Dynamic Block will be visible to everyone.
   - If the Customer does not belong to any Segments and the Dynamic Block is created for All Segments, the contents of Dynamic Block will still be displayed.
   - If all Customer Segments that were assigned to Dynamic Block are deleted, its contents will be visible to everyone.
