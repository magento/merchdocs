title: Page Builder - Layout
---

The _Layout_ section of the Page Builder panel is used to add rows, columns, or tabs to the stage. When you drag a content type from the panel to the stage, a container appears with a toolbox of options that are specific to the content type.

By default, the Page Builder stage is empty. As you drag layout content types from the panel to the [stage]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}#stage), you can place them above, below, or inside other layout containers on the page. Rows can only be added directly to the stage.

_Page Builder panel with layout content types and stage_

## Layout content types

| Type  | Description |
| -------- |-------- |
| [Row]({% link cms/page-builder-layout-row.md %}) | A new row can only be dragged from the panel to the stage, and positioned either above or below another row, tab, or column group. You can also use the Duplicate option to make a copy of an existing row. |
| [Column]({% link cms/page-builder-layout-column.md %}) | A column can be dragged from the panel to the stage, or to rows and tabs. The maximum number of columns that can be added is determined by the number of grid divisions that is specified in the [configuration]({% link cms/page-builder-setup.md %}). |
| [Tabs]({% link cms/page-builder-layout-tabs.md %}) | A single tab can be dragged from the panel to the stage, or to rows and columns. Additional tabs can be added from the toolbox. |
