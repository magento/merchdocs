title: New Products List
---

The list of new products is an example of dynamic content, and consists of live data that is pulled from your product catalog. By default, the _New Products_ list includes the first eight of the most recently added products. However, it can also be configured to include only products within a specified date range.

## Step 1: Set each product as new

For Adobe Commerce stores, see [Scheduling an Update]({% link cms/content-staging-scheduled-update.md %}) and then continue to the Step 2 on this page.
_Set Product as New_ date range setting can be configured only in scheduled updates.

Setting a product as new adds the product to the _New products_ list. You can change the setting back at any point when you no longer want to include it in the list.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. Find each product that you want to feature and open in edit mode.

1. For **Set Product as New**, toggle the option to set the product as a new product or not.

The code that determines the content of the New Products list and its placement in your store is generated by the Widget tool.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add Widget</span>.

1. In the _Settings_ section, do the following:

   - Set **Type** to `Catalog New Products List`.

   - Choose the **Design Theme** that is used by the store.

1. Click <span class="btn">Continue</span>.

      You can select a specific store view, or `All Store Views`. To select multiple views, hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) and click each option.

   - (Optional) For **Sort Order**, enter a number to determine the order this item appears with others in the same part of the page. (`0` = first, `1` = second, `3` = third, and so on.)

## Step 4: Configure the List

1. In the left panel, choose **Widget Options**.

1. Set **Display Products** to one of the following:

   | All Products | Lists products in sequence, starting with those most recently added. |
   | New Products | Lists only the products that are identified as _new_. A product is considered to be new during the date range that is specified in _Set Product As New From/To_. The list will be empty if the date range expires without any new products defined. |

1. To provide navigation control for lists with multiple pages, set **Display Page Control** to `Yes`.

   For **Number of Products per Page**, enter the number of products you want to appear on each page.

1. Set **Number of Products to Display** to the number of new products that you want to include in the list.

   The default setting is `10`.

1. For **Cache Lifetime (Seconds)**, choose how often you want to refresh the list of new products.

   By default, the cache is set to 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
