title: New Products List
---

The list of new products is an example of dynamic content, and consists of live data that is pulled from your product catalog. By default, the _New Products_ list includes the first eight of the most recently added products. However, it can also be configured to include only products within a specified date range.

## Step 1: Set the date range for each product

To make a product appear in the list by date range, the _New From_ dates must be entered in the product. The product then appears in the New Products list during the date range specified.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. Find each product that you want to feature and open in edit mode.

1. For **Set Product as New From**, click the calendar (![Calendar icon]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %})) icon and choose the first date that you want the product to be featured.

1. For **To**, click the calendar (![Calendar icon]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %})) icon and choose the last date that you want the product to be featured.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

1. When you are prompted to reindex and refresh the page cache, click the links at the top of the page and follow the instructions.

   The list of products now appears on the Home Page for the specified date range.

## Step 2: Create the widget

The code that determines the content of the New Products list and its placement in your store is generated by the Widget tool.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Elements_ > **Widgets**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add Widget</span>.

1. In the _Settings_ section, do the following:

   - Set **Type** to `Catalog New Products List`.

   - Choose the **Design Theme** that is used by the store.

1. Click <span class="btn">Continue</span>.

1. In the _Storefront Properties_ section, do the following:

   - For **Widget Title**, enter a descriptive title for the widget. (This title is visible only from the _Admin_.)

   - For **Assign to Store Views**, select the store views where the widget will be visible.

      You can select a specific store view, or `All Store Views`. To select multiple views, hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) and click each option.

   - (Optional) For **Sort Order**, enter a number to determine the order this item appears with others in the same part of the page. (`0` = first, `1` = second, `3` = third, and so on.)

1. Click <span class="btn">Save and Continue Edit</span>.

   For now, you can ignore the message to refresh the cache.

## Step 4: Configure the List

1. In the left panel, choose **Widget Options**.

1. Set **Display Products** to one of the following:

   | All Products | Lists products in sequence, starting with those most recently added. |
   | New Products | Lists only the products that are identified as _new_. A product is considered to be new during the date range that is specified in _Set Product As New From/To_. The list will be empty if the date range expires without any new products defined. |

1. To provide navigation control for lists with multiple pages, set **Display Page Control** to `Yes`.

   For **Number of Products per Page**, enter the number of products you want to appear on each page.

1. Set **Number of Products to Display** to the number of new products that you want to include in the list.

   The default setting is `10`.

1. For **Cache Lifetime (Seconds)**, choose how often you want to refresh the list of new products.

   By default, the cache is set to 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
