title: Positioning Blocks
---

The code that controls the page layout and placement of blocks is written in XML [Widgets]({% link cms/widgets.md %}) to make it easy to position a block at a specific place on the page, and even for a specific product or category without writing any code. You can choose each option from a list, rather than trying to remember all of the possible combinations.

The following list describes the locations by page type where blocks are typically placed. For more information about how areas on the page are defined, see [Standard Page Layouts]({% link design/page-layout-standard.md %}).
