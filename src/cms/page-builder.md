Starting with Magento 2.4.1, content editing is now full-screen only for all areas controlled by Page Builder. This includes CMS pages, product and category pages, blocks, and dynamic blocks. Full-screen editing puts the focus on your content and provides a view that better matches the user experience on the storefront.
