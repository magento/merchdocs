Merchants can integrate [Adobe Stock][adobe-stock] with Magento giving them access to countless media assets for use in their stores.

The Adobe Stock service provides businesses with access to millions of high-quality, curated, royalty-free photos, vectors, illustrations, videos, templates, and 3D assets for all their creative projects. Magento users are able to quickly find, preview, and license Adobe Stock assets. Users can also save them to the
[Media Storage][media-storage], all without leaving the Magento workspace.

## Prerequisites

This integration requires an [adobe.io Console][io-console] account and Magento 2.3.4 or newer. In order to license [Adobe Stock][adobe-stock] images, a paid [Adobe Stock][adobe-stock] plan and an [Adobe account][adobe-signin] are also required.

## Integrate Magento and Adobe Stock

Configuring the Adobe Stock Integration for Magento is a two-step process: [create an adobe.io integration][create-integration] to generate an API Key, and
then [configure the Adobe Stock Integration in your Magento Admin][configure].

### Create an Adobe.io integration

1. Navigate to the [adobe.io Console][io-console]. Under **Quick Start**, select the **Projects** tab and click **Create new project**.

1. Click **Add API** in the **Get started** block.

1. Select **Creative SDK** from the integrations list and click **Continue**.

   At this time, _do not_ use the **Adobe Stock** service on this screen.

1. Select **Oauth 2.0 Web** platform.

1. Specify the **Redirect URI**.

   - The default redirect URI is in the form `${HOST}/${ADMIN_URI}/adobe_ims/oauth/callback/`, such as `https://store.myshop.com/admin_hgkq1l/adobe_ims/oauth/callback/`.

        where:

         - `${HOST}` is your Magento fully qualified domain name (i.e., `https://store.myshop.com`).
         - `${ADMIN_URI}` is your Magento Admin URI (such as `admin_hgkq1l`), which can be retrieved by running `magento info:adminuri`.

1. Specify the **Redirect URI pattern**, which is the same as your redirect URI with two differences:

   - Any periods (`.`) must be escaped with two backslashes (`\\`).
   - Add `.*` to the end of the pattern.

        Using the example from the previous Default redirect URI field, this would be `https://store\\.myshop\\.com/admin_hgkq1l/adobe_ims/oauth/callback/.*`.

1. Click **Save configured API**.

1. On the page that follows, copy your **Client ID (API Key)** and **Client secret**.

   This information is used in the [next section][configure].

### Configure the Adobe Stock Integration

Use the **API Key** and **Client secret** generated in the [previous section][create-integration] to set the system configuration in your Magento Admin.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Advanced** and choose **System**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) **Adobe Stock Integration** and do the following:

   - Set **Enabled Adobe Stock** to `Yes`.

   - Enter your **API Key (Client ID)**.

   - Enter your **Client Secret**.

   - Click <span class="btn">Test Connection</span> to validate your keys.

   Give the validation a few seconds. If your credentials are valid, you should see a green "Connection Successful!" message.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
