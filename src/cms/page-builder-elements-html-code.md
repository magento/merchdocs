Use the HTML Code content type to add snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to the stage. For example, you might want to add custom HTML, declare a CSS class that can be applied to an element on the page, or add a snippet of code for a logo, button, or banner that you received from a third-party provider.

## Add HTML code

The following example demonstrates how to embed [Google Font][1] code and declare custom heading classes that override the current stylesheet.

### Step 1: Choose a Google font

1. Visit the [Google Fonts][1] site and choose the font family that you want to use.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-html-code-google-fonts.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Google Fonts site_

1. Copy the generated code that is to be embedded in the `<head>` section of the page and paste it temporarily into a text editor.

   - Embed Font code
   - CSS Rule

1. Add the font-family rule to each heading class, enclosing the heading classes in a `<style>` tag.

   This is the code that will be pasted into Page Builder.

   ```html
   <style>
      h1 {color: teal; font-family: 'Khand', sans-serif; }
      h2 {color: teal; font-family: 'Khand', sans-serif; }
      h3 {color: teal; font-family: 'Khand', sans-serif; }
   </style>
   ```

### Step 2: Add the code to the page

1. In the _Admin_ sidebar of your store, go to **Content** > _Elements_ > **Pages**.

1. Find the page where the font is to be available and open it in edit mode.

1. Scroll down  and expand the **Content** section.

1. In the Page Builder panel, expand **Elements** and drag an **HTML Code** placeholder to a row, column, or tab set on the stage.

   Use the red guideline to position the divider either before or after another content container in the row, column, or tab set.

1. Hover over the HTML container to display the toolbox and choose the _Settings_ ( ![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})), icon.

1. In the text box, paste the embed Google Fonts code and style declarations that you prepared.

   To make it easier to read, you can enter a few spaces to indent the code.

   _HTML code and styles_

1. Update the remaining settings as needed (see [Change HTML code settings][#html-settings] for details).

1. In the upper-right corner, <span class="btn">Save</span> the settings and return to the Page Builder workspace.

   The new font renders when the page is viewed through a browser.

### Step 3: Preview the page

1. In the _Currently Active_ section, set **Enable Page** to `Yes`.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-html-code-enable-page.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Enabling the page_

1. In the upper-right corner, click the **Save** arrow and choose **Save & Close**.

1. Find the page in the grid and select **View** in the _Actions_ column.

## Change HTML code settings {#html-settings}

1. Hover over the HTML container to display the toolbox and choose the _Settings_ (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})) icon.

1. In the text box, edit the code as needed.

   This supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Code snippets that belong in the `<head>` section of the page can be entered here.

   The editor also provides buttons to insert special elements in the code:

   |Insert Widget...|Click to insert a Magento widget at the cursor's position in the HTML text box.|
   |Insert Image...|Click to insert an uploaded image or an image from the Gallery at the cursor's position in the HTML text box.|
   |Insert Variable...|Click to insert a Magento variables at the cursor's position in the HTML text box.|

1. Update the _Advanced_ settings as needed.

   - Choose an **Alignment** to control the positioning of the code within the parent container:

      |Default|Applies the alignment default setting that is specified in the style sheet of the current theme.
      |Left|Aligns the list along the left border of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.
      |Center|Aligns the list in the center of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.
      |Right|Aligns the block along the right border of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.

      In the following example, the options are set to use a center alignment for the rendered code block.

      ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-elements-divider-settings-advanced-alignment-center.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Divider with a center alignment_

   - Set the **Border** style applied to all four sides of the code container:

      |Default|Applies the default border style that is specified by the associated style sheet.
      |None|Does not provide any visible indication of the container borders.
      |Dotted|The container border appears as a dotted line.
      |Dashed|The container border appears as a dashed line.
      |Solid|The container border appears as a solid line.
      |Double|The container border appears as a double line.
      |Groove|The container border appears as a grooved line.
      |Ridge|The container border appears as a ridged line.
      |Inset|The container border appears as a inset line.
      |Outset|The container border appears as a outset line.

   - If you set a border style other than `None`, complete the border display options:

      - **Border Color** - Specify the color by choosing a swatch, clicking the color picker, or by entering a valid color name or equivalent hexadecimal value.

      - **Border Width** - Enter the number of pixels for the border line width.

      - **Border Radius** - Enter the number of pixels to define the size of the radius that is used to round each corner of the border.

   - (Optional) Specify the names of **CSS classes** from the current style sheet to apply to the container.

      Separate multiple class names with a space.

   - Enter values, in pixels, for the **Margins and Padding** to determine the outer margins and inner padding of the code container.

      Enter the corresponding values in the diagram.

      |Margins|The amount of blank space that is applied to the outside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left
      |Padding|The amount of blank space that is applied to the inside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left
