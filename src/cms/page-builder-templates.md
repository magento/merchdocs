Page Builder templates are containers that save both content and layouts of existing pages, blocks, dynamic blocks, product attributes, and category descriptions. Using templates saves you a lot of time and effort when creating new content (or replacing older content). For example, you can save your existing Page Builder content as a template and then apply that template (with all its content and layouts) to another area to quickly create new Page Builder content.

## Save content as a template

{:.procedure}
To save your existing Page Builder content as a template:

1. Navigate to the Page Builder content you want to save as a template.

1. In the Page Builder content area, click <span class="btn">Save as Template</span> at the top right-hand side.

   ![Page Builder Save as Template button]({% link images/images-ee/pagebuilder-templates-saveastemplate-button.png %}){: .zoom}

1. In the **Template Name** field of the _Save Content as Template_ dialog, enter a unique name for the template. A unique name is required so that it can be searched, selected, and applied to another content area as needed.

1. **Created For** is an optional selector you can use to assign the template to a particular content area so that it can be filtered and more easily found when you want to apply that template later. Assigning the template to a particular content area does not limit its use to that area. You can use any template anywhere that Page Builder content is allowed.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save</span>. A confirmation message appears indicating that your template is saved.

## Apply a template

![Page Builder Apply Template grid]({% link images/images-ee/pagebuilder-templates-apply-slideout-withfilters.png %}){: .zoom}

1. Use the search box at the top left-hand side to filter the grid by **Template Name**, based on the text entered.

1. Use <span class="btn">Filters</span> to open the filters options, where you can filter templates by:

   - A range of template IDs (**ID**)
   - A range of creation dates (**Created**)
   - The template name (**Template Name**)
   - The content area (**Created For**)
