      ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-media-image-settings-image-link-url-newtab.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Link to a URL_

      ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-media-image-settings-image-link-product-results.png %}){: .zoom}

   If you want to prevent the visitor from navigating away from your store, select the **Open in new tab** checkbox. When the checkbox is cleared, the linked destination opens in the same browser tab, which could effectively navigate the visitor away from your store.

1. To add an **Image Caption**, enter the text that you want to appear below the image.

   The format of the caption is determined by the stylesheet that is associated with the current theme.  T

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-media-image-settings-caption.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Image caption_

   The caption typically appears below the image, and provides information about the image for visitors and search engines. If your site is available in multiple languages, you might use the same image, but  translate the caption. In HTML, the `<figcaption>` tag is a subset of the `<figure>` tag. `<figcaption>This is the image caption</figcaption>`

1. Update any of the other settings as needed:

   - [Search Engine Optimization](#search-engine-optimization)
   - [Advanced](#advanced)

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span> in the upper-right corner to close the _Edit Image_ page.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

## Search Engine Optimization

Text for these settings is visible to search engines and improves the way the page is indexed.

- For **Alternative Text**, enter the _alt_ text that you want to be available to improve accessibility.

   The use of alt text is an accessibility best practice, and in some locales is required by law. The `alt` attribute is a subset of the image tag. `<image title="tooltip" alt="description" src="image.jpg">`

- For **Title Attribute**, enter the text that you want to appear as a tooltip on mouseover.

   As a best practice, choose a descriptive, keyword-rich title to improve the way the image is indexed by search engines. In HTML, the `title` attribute is a subset of the image tag. `<image title="tooltip" alt="description" src="image.jpg">`|
