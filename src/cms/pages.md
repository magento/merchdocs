All content can be viewed in terms of its shelf life, just as any product in a store. Did you know that the shelf life of social media content is less than twenty-four hours? The potential shelf life of the content you create can help you decide where to invest your resources.

Content with a long shelf life is sometimes referred to as _evergreen content_. Examples of evergreen content include customer success stories, _how to_ instructions, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). In contrast, content that is perishable by nature includes events, industry news, and press releases.
