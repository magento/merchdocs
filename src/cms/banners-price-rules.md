DEPRECATED: [Page Builder]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cms/page-builder.md %})’s advanced content tools replace the previous banner functionality as described in this topic. We keep this content in the user guide as a convenience for those whose stores have customizations that prevent them from using Page Builder.

Any banners you create can be associated with both catalog and cart price rules for a promotion. To associate a banner with a price rule, you must first create both the banner and the price rule. Related banners can be associated with a price rule from the Banner tool, or from either the [Cart Price Rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}) or [Catalog Price Rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %}) tool.

## To associate a banner with a price rule:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Promotions_ and choose one of the following:

    - **Catalog Price Rule**
    - **Cart Price Rules**

1. In the grid, open the rule where you want to associate the banner. Then, do the following:

    - Scroll down and expand ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} **Related Banners** to display the lists of available Cart and Catalog Price Rules.

        ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images-ee/banner-related-promotions.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Related Promotions_

    - If necessary, use the search filters to find the price rule(s) that you want. Then, select the checkbox of each banner that you want to associate with the price rule.

    {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info }
    If your banners don’t appear in the grid, click **Reset Filter**.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Rule</span>.
