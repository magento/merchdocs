Use the Row content type to add a new row to the stage. The row is the basic building block of all Page Builder content. Whenever you create new content, the stage is initially populated with a single, blank row. The row toolbox appears when you hover over the container. The toolbox includes options to move, hide, duplicate, edit, or remove the row. The selection of settings determines the appearance, background and layout of the row. Additional content elements can be dragged to the row from the Page Builder panel on the left.

## Add a row

1. In the Page Builder panel under **Layout**, drag a new **Row** to the stage, just below the first row.

1. To format the row, hover over the container. Then, choose **Settings**  in the toolbox and complete the settings as described in the following sections.

1. To preview how the content looks from the storefront, click the **Full Screen** icon (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-fullscreen.png %})).

   You can continue to work in full screen mode or click **Close** ( X ) in the upper-right corner to return to the workspace.

1. When the settings are complete, scroll up to the top of the page and click <span class="btn">Save & Close</span> to return to the Pages grid.

   _Adding a Row_

### Appearance

The Appearance setting determines how the background color and/or background image appears in relation to the container and width of the content area.

#### Layout

- Enter the **Minimum Height** for the row. This value can be a number with any valid CSS unit (such as 100px, 50%, 50em, 100vh) or a calculation (such as 100vh - 237px).

   For example, you can set the minimum height of a row to stretch the full-height of the page, giving you compelling options for full-page background images and videos.

- Choose one of the following **Vertical Alignment** settings to align any content containers that are added to the row:

   - Top
   - Center
   - Bottom

#### Method 1: Enter the Value

In the _No Color_ box, enter one of the following:

- A predefined color name, such as `White`

#### Method 2: Choose the Value

    _Choose Swatch_

1. Set the opacity of the background color:

    Page Builder supports a transparency layer, or _alpha channel_, that can be used to create backgrounds with varying degrees of opacity.

   **Background Type**

   A background type can be an image or a video. Page Builder defaults to `Image` and shows various image settings. If you select `Video`, Page Builder swaps the image settings with video settings. Both background types are described as follows.

   _Background Type_

   **Background Image**

   - To apply a background image to the row, do one of the following:

      The box below the slider shows the current red, green, blue, and alpha values (rgba). The last number indicates the current opacity percentage as a decimal.

### Background Image

1. To apply a **Background Image** to the row, do one of the following:

   - Set the **Background Size** to one of the following:

    ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-tutorial1-row-settings-background-image-selected.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Background Image_

1. To use a different background image for mobile devices, repeat these steps to specify the **Background Mobile Image** that you want to use.

### Background Size and Position

1. Set the **Background Size** to one of the following:

   | Cover | The background image covers the full width of the row. |
   | Contain | The background image is limited to the width of the content area. |
   | Auto | Applies the size from the current style sheet. |

    ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-layout-row-settings-background-size-cover.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Background Size_

1. To determine how the background image is anchored in relation to the row, set **Background Position** to one of the following:

   | Top | Left / Center / Right |
   | Center | Left / Center / Right |
   | Bottom | Left / Center / Right |

    The anchor point is like a push pin that attaches the image to the row at the specified background position.

1. Set **Background Attachment** to one of the following:

   **Background Video**

   To apply a background video to the row, do the following:

   - In the **Video URL** field, enter a valid video URL. Valid video URLs can be:

      - links to YouTube videos: `https://youtu.be/CoDhMRUUjeI`
      - links to Vimeo videos: `https://vimeo.com/190156113`

   - Apply additional settings as follows:

      - Select an **Overlay Color** to apply a transparent tint to the video.
      - Change **Infinite Loop**, **Lazy Load**, and **Play Only When Visible** settings as needed. By default, all these settings are set to `Yes`.
      - Add a **Fallback Image** to display on the screen before a video loads and in the event that the video does not load for some reason.

    For example, you might set Minimum Height to match the height of a background image to ensure that the full image is visible.

1. Choose one of the following **Vertical Alignment** settings to align any content containers that are added to the row:

   - `Top`
   - `Center`
   - `Bottom`
