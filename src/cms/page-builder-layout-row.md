Use the Row content type to add a new row to the stage. The row is the basic building block of all Page Builder content. Whenever you create new content, the stage is initially populated with a single, blank row. The row toolbox appears when you hover over the container. The toolbox includes options to move, hide, duplicate, edit, or remove the row. The selection of settings determines the appearance, background and layout of the row. Additional content elements can be dragged to the row from the Page Builder panel on the left.

- A predefined color name, such as `White`
- The hexadecimal color value for the color, such as `#ffffff`
- The rgba value for the color, with opacity percent, such as `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75)`

#### Method 2: Choose the Value

1. Set the opacity of the background color:

    Page Builder supports a transparency layer, or _alpha channel_, that can be used to create backgrounds with varying degrees of opacity.

   - Locate the **Opacity** slider just below the color picker.

   - Drag the slider to the 75% setting. Then, click <span class="btn">Apply</span>.

      The box below the slider shows the current red, green, blue, and alpha values (rgba). The last number indicates the current opacity percentage as a decimal.
