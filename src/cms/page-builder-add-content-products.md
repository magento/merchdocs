title: Add Content - Products
---

Use the _Products_ content type to add a list of products to the [Page Builder stage]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}#stage), using either a grid or carousel layout. You also can use the [Add Content - Block]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content-block.md %}) tool to place the block on the Page Builder stage and then place a product list within the block. Or, you can add the product list directly in a row on a page.

## Guidelines for using the product carousel

The product carousel provides a powerful and engaging way to show off your products. To get the most out of it, we recommend adhering to the following guidelines:

- Add product carousels directly to page-width containers like rows, tabs, or one-column layouts. Using page-width layouts ensure the best responsive display of your products. Page Builder reduces the number of products shown depending on the width of the page, not the width of the container.

- Do not add a product carousel to a narrow column. As mentioned, Page Builder, by default, determines the number of products to display based on the page width, not the column width.

- If you want your product carousel to auto-scroll continuously, set both **Autoplay** and **Infinite Loop** to `Yes`. If Autoplay is set to `Yes` but Infinite Loop is set to `No`, auto-scrolling will stop at the end of your products list.

- Set the **Carousel Mode** to `Continuous` in order to highlight, center, and scroll one product at a time within the carousel. The other products will be visible in the list, but transparent in order to highlight the centered product.

- Keep the **Carousel Mode** set to `Default` to show and scroll up to five products at a time within the carousel.

The following instructions show how to add a Products list to a block. You can then use a [widget]({% link cms/widgets.md %}) to place the block at a specific location on any page in your store.

## Create a products list block

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Elements_ > **Blocks**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add New Block</span>.

1. Enter the **Block Title** and **Identifier**.

1. Choose the **Store View** where the block is to be available.

1. Scroll down and click <span class="btn">Edit with Page Builder</span> or inside the content preview area to open the Page Builder workspace.

1. In the Page Builder panel, expand **Add Content** and drag a **Products** placeholder to the stage.

   ![Add Products content type]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-add-content-products-drag.png %}){: .zoom}

## Configure the products list container

Hover over the empty _Products_ container to display the toolbox and click the _Settings_ (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})) icon.

![Products Toolbox]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-add-content-products-toolbox.png %}){: .zoom}
_Products toolbox_

Complete the _Settings_ according to the following sections:

### Appearance

1. Choose one of the appearance types to determine how the products list is displayed on the page:

   | Product Grid     | Displays the products within a grid that shows five products per row (by default), with as many rows as needed to display the number entered in the **Number of Products to Display** setting.  |
   | Product Carousel | Displays the products within a carousel (also known as a slider). The carousel shows up to five products per slide. <br/><br/>**Responsiveness Alert**: When you select this appearance, it is best to add the Products content type directly to a row, tab, or one-column layout where it is responsive, showing fewer products per side on smaller screens. If you add it to content types that are narrower than the width of the page (such as a narrow column), the carousel will display more products per slide than the container allows, regardless of the screen size. |

   _Setting the product appearance_

   If you choose the product carousel, you must also configure the [Carousel Settings](#carousel-settings).

1. For **Select Products By**, choose the method for product selection:

   You can select your products by category, SKU, or condition. These options are mutually exclusive. For example, you cannot select the Category option, use the Category selector, then switch over to the Condition option to add some conditions. Your products will only be selected based on what you set for _one_ of these three options.

   - **Category** - Choose this option to display products using a selected category.

      ![Product selection by category]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-settings_category.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Selecting products by category_

      When selected, this option provides a **Category** selector. Click the arrow and drill down to choose the category of products to display. For example, in the Magento sample data, drilling in and selecting the _Women > Tops > Tees_ displays all products for that category.

      ![Selecting a catalog category]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-select-products-by-category.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Selecting the women's tees category_

   - **SKU** - Choose this option to display products using one or more SKUs

      When selected, this option provides a **Product SKUs** text box where you must enter a comma-separated list of SKUs to display.

      ![Product selection by SKU]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-settings_sku.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Selecting products by SKU_

   - **Condition** - Choose this option to display products according to one or more conditions that you define.

      When selected, there are tools available to add conditions to your products selection. For example, you could select only products with a Gender set to Unisex.

      _Selecting products by condition_

   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
   Selecting the Category or SKU option provides an additional **Sort By** option of `Position`. With this sort option, the products will appear in the same order that they appear in your catalog.

   For the Category option, sorting by position displays the products in the same order that they appear in your catalog. For the SKU option, sorting by position displays the products in the order that you enter them in the **Product SKUs** textbox.
   </div>

1. For **Sort By**, choose the sort order for the products in the list:

   |Position (for Category and SKU options only)|When you select the Category option, the Position displays products in the same order as their position in the catalog. When you select the SKU option, the Position displays products in the same order as the SKUs within the Product SKUs textbox.
   |Newest products first|Sorts products by the date they were added to the catalog, displaying the products with the most recent entry dates first.
   |Oldest products first|Sorts products by the date they were added to the catalog, displaying the products with the oldest entry dates first.
   |Name: A - Z|Sorts products in alphabetical order.
   |Name: Z - A|Sorts products in reverse alphabetical order.
   |SKU: ascending|Sorts products by SKU in alphanumeric order.
   |SKU: descending|Sorts products by SKU in reverse alphanumeric order.
   |Stock: low stock first|Sorts products from the lowest to the highest available stock.
   |Stock: high stock first|Sorts products from the highest to the lowest available stock.
   |Price: high to low|Sorts products from highest to lowest price.
   |Price: low to high|Sorts products from lowest to highest price.

   ![Product sorting options]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-sortby.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Choosing the product sorting option_

1. Enter the **Number of Products to Display** in the carousel or grid.

   Values can be from `1` to `999`. The default is `5` for a grid and `20` for a carousel.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Some products in the Category, SKU, or Condition settings may not appear in your products grid or carousel. For example, disabled products, products marked as not visible, out-of-stock products, and products assigned to another website will not be displayed.

### Carousel Settings

1. Choose the **Carousel Mode** to determine how the products are displayed within the carousel.

   |Default|The carousel displays five products per slide by default and responsively reduces that number as needed.
   |Continuous|The carousel displays five products per slide by default (with an additional half of a product on the right and left), but centers and scrolls one product at a time in an infinite loop. Products to the right and left of the centered product are dimmed so that the center product is highlighted.

   If you switch between these two modes, the other carousel settings are retained, with the exception of the **Infinite Loop** setting, which is always set to `Yes` in Continuous mode and the field is disabled.

   ![Carousel Settings]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-carousel-settings.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Carousel Settings_

1. If needed, set the **Autoplay** option to `Yes`.

   When autoplay is enabled, the carousel begins scrolling automatically when the page loads. If you leave the default setting (`No`), the customer must click the slide navigation (dots or arrows) to display each slide in sequence.

   If you enable this feature, enter **Autoplay Speed** to specify the delay in milliseconds between each slide. The default value is `4000` ms (4 seconds).

1. If needed, set the **Infinite Loop** option to `Yes`.

   When infinite loop is enabled, the slide show replays indefinitely while the page is open. If you leave the default setting (`No`),  the slide show plays only once.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Be aware that if you set **Infinite Loop** to `No` and **Autoplay** set to `Yes`, the autoplay will stop at the end of the number of products to be displayed.

1. If needed, set the **Show Arrows** option to `Yes`.

   When this is enabled, each slide includes _next_ and _previous_ navigation arrows on the left and right side. If you leave the default setting (`No`), the slides do not display navigation arrows.

1. If needed, set the **Show Dots** option to `No`.

   When set to the default setting (`Yes`), navigation dots appear at the bottom of the carousel slider. If you disable this setting, the carousel slider does not display navigation dots.

### Advanced

1. Choose the **Alignment** to control the positioning of the Products list within the parent container:

   |Default|Applies the alignment default setting that is specified in the style sheet of the current theme.
   |Left|Aligns the list along the left border of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.
   |Center|Aligns the list in the center of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.
   |Right|Aligns the list along the right border of the parent container, with allowance for any padding that is specified.

1. Set the **Border** style applied to all four sides of the Products container:

   |Default|Applies the default border style that is specified by the associated style sheet.
   |None|Does not provide any visible indication of the container borders.
   |Dotted|The container border appears as a dotted line.
   |Dashed|The container border appears as a dashed line.
   |Solid|The container border appears as a solid line.
   |Double|The container border appears as a double line.
   |Groove|The container border appears as a grooved line.
   |Ridge|The container border appears as a ridged line.
   |Inset|The container border appears as a inset line.
   |Outset|The container border appears as a outset line.

1. If you set a border style other than `None`, complete the border display options:

   - **Border Color** - Specify the color by choosing a swatch, clicking the color picker, or by entering a valid color name or equivalent hexadecimal value.

   - **Border Width** - Enter the number of pixels for the border line width.

   - **Border Radius** - Enter the number of pixels to define the size of the radius that is used to round each corner of the border.

1. (Optional) Specify the names of **CSS classes** from the current style sheet to apply to the container.

   Separate multiple class names with a space.

1. Enter values, in pixels, for the **Margins and Padding** to determine the outer margins and inner padding of the Products container.

   Enter the corresponding values in the diagram.

   |Margins|The amount of blank space that is applied to the outside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left
   |Padding|The amount of blank space that is applied to the inside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left

## Save and preview on the stage

In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Save</span> to apply the settings and return to the Page Builder workspace.

If you configured a product carousel, it should look similar to the following example:

![Product carousel on the stage]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-admin-carousel.png %}){: .zoom}
_Products carousel on the stage_

You can now use a [widget]({% link cms/widgets.md %}) to place this block wherever you want it to appear in the store. Or, you can use [Add Content - Block]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content-block.md %}) to add the block to an existing page, tab, or block.
