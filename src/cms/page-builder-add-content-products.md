Use the Products content type to add a list of products to the stage, using either a grid or carousel layout. You also can use the [Add Content - Block]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content-block.md %}) tool to place the block, with product list, on the Page Builder stage. Or, you can add the product list directly to a row on a page.

## Guidelines for using the Products content type

The Products content type provides a powerful and engaging way to show off your products. To get the most out of it, we recommend adhering to the following guidelines:

- Use the Product carousel directly within a Row to ensure a responsive layout of your products. Currently, inserting a Product carousel inside a Column or Tab will break responsiveness.

- If you want your Product carousel to auto-scroll continuously, set both **Autoplay** and **Infinite Loop** to `Yes`. If Autoplay is set to `Yes` but Infinite Loop is set to `No`, auto-scrolling will stop at the end of your products list. So to ensure continuous scrolling, ensure both of these settings are set to `Yes`.

- Set the Products **Carousel Mode** to `Continuous` in order to highlight, center, and scroll one product at a time within the carousel. The other products will be visible in the list, but transparent in order to highlight the centered product.

- Keep the Products **Carousel Mode** set to `Default` to show and scroll up to five products at a time within the carousel.

The following example shows how to add a product list to a block. A [widget]({% link cms/widgets.md %}) can then be used to place the block at a specific location on any page in your store.

## To add a Products content type

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Elements_ > **Blocks**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add New Block</span> and do the following:

   - Enter the **Block Title** and **Identifier**. Then, choose the **Store View** where the block is to be available.

   - Scroll down to the Page Builder workspace. Then, in the Page Builder panel under **Add Content**, drag a **Products** placeholder to the stage.

   ![Add Products content type]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-add-content-products-drag.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Add Products_

1. Hover over the empty container. Then, choose **Settings** (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %}){: .Inline}) in the toolbox to open the Products form.

   ![Products Toolbox]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-add-content-products-toolbox.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Products Toolbox_

### Select Appearance

1. Choose the **Product Carousel** for the Appearance (layout) of your products list:

   ![Product Appearances]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-appearances.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Product Appearances_

1. In the **Carousel Settings**, configure the settings to match the following screenshot:

   ![Carousel Settings]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-carousel-settings.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Carousel Settings_

   See the [Product Carousel Settings] table below for descriptions of each setting.

### Select Products By

You can select your products by **Category**, **SKU**, or **Condition**. The Category and SKU settings can also be set within the Condition settings. However, selecting the Category or SKU buttons provides an additional **Sort By** option of **Position**. For the Category option, sorting by Position displays the products in the same order that they appear in your Catalog. For the SKU option, sorting by Position displays the products in the order they appear within the Product SKUs textbox. For more information on the Position setting, see [Select Products By Settings]: Product SKUs and Sort By.

Settings for these selection options are shown here:

   ![Selecting Products By Catagory]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-settings_category.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Selecting Products By Catagory_

   ![Selecting Products By SKU]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-settings_sku.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Selecting Products By SKU_

   ![Selecting Products By Condition]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-settings_condition.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Selecting Products By Condition_

1. Select the **Category** option button for **Select Products By** and select Women > Tops > Tees from the Category selector:

   ![Selecting Products with Category selector]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-select-products-by-category.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Selecting Products By Category_

1. For **Sort By**, select **Position** (the default option):

   ![Product Sorting Options]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-sortby.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Product Sorting Options_

1. Enter the **Number of Products to Display** in the Product Carousel or Grid.

   Values can be from 1 to 999.

1. In the upper-right corner of the form, click <span class="btn">Save</span> to return to the Page Builder workspace. Your Products carousel should look something like this on the stage:

   ![Products List on Admin Stage]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-products-admin-carousel.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Products List on Admin Stage_

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

You can now use a [widget]({% link cms/widgets.md %}) to place this block wherever you want it to appear in the store. Or, use [Add Content - Block]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content-block.md %}) to add the block to an existing page, tab, or block.

| Product Grid     | Displays the products within a grid that shows five products per row (by default), with as many rows as needed to display the number entered in the **Number of Products to Display** setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Product Carousel | Displays the products within a carousel (also known as a slider). The carousel shows up to five products per slide. <br/><br/>**Responsiveness Alert**: When you select this appearance, it is best to add the Products content type directly to a Row where it is responsive, showing fewer products per side on smaller screens. If you add it to any other content type (such as a Column or Tab), the carousel always shows five products per slide, regardless of the screen size. |

## Select Products By Settings

The three options for selecting products -- by **Category**, **SKU**, or **Condition** -- are mutually exclusive. For example, you cannot select the Category option, use the Category selector, then switch over to the Condition option to add some conditions. Your products will only be selected based on what you enter in the fields from _one_ of these three options.

| Condition                     | Selects products to display from the conditions you define. When selected, this option provides a **Condition** selector for adding conditions to your products selection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Category selector             | Provides a selector that lists all the categories within your catalog to choose from. For example, in the Magento sample data, selecting the Watches category displays all the watch products within that category. Additionally, if **Sort By** is set to **Position**, the products will appear in the same order that they appear in your catalog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Product SKUs                  | Provides a textbox into which you can enter SKUs for the enabled products you want to display. If you enter a SKU for a disabled product, it will not display. Additionally, if **Sort By** is set to **Position**, these SKUs will appear in the Products list in the same order you enter them into this textbox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Condition selector            | Provides a selector to add conditions (Gender, Price, Weight, and so on) for selecting the products you want to display in the Products list. For example, you could select only products with a Gender set to Unisex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Carousel Mode  | Determines how the products are displayed within the carousel. Options: <br/>**Default** - The carousel displays five products per slide by default and responsively reduces that number as needed. <br/>**Continuous** - The carousel displays five products per slide by default (with an additional half of a product on the right and left), but centers and scrolls one product at a time in an infinite loop. Products to the right and left of the centered product are dimmed so that the center product is highlighted. Settings between these two modes are retained, with the exception of the **Infinite Loop** setting, which is always set to `Yes` in Continuous mode and the field is disabled. |
| Autoplay       | Determines if the carousel begins scrolling automatically when the page loads. Options: <br/>**Yes** - The carousel scrolls automatically as soon as the page loads. <br/>**No** - After the first slide, which appears by default, the slide navigation (dots or arrows) must be clicked to display the next slide in sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Options: <br/>**Yes** - The slide show replays indefinitely while the page is open. <br/>**No** - The slide show plays only once. Be aware that if you set **Infinite Loop** to `No` and **Autoplay** set to `Yes`, the autoplay will stop at the end of the number of products being displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
