1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

## Create a link

The Insert Link button in the editor makes it easy to add a hyperlink to an image in the gallery. However, it can also be used to create an inline link in text, provided that you have the URL in advance. Unlike the Widget button, the Insert/Edit link button is not integrated with pages, products, or categories in the store.

To create a link for a telephone number or email, see [Adding Custom Variables]({% link marketing/variables-custom.md %}).

1. In the storefront, navigate to the page that is to be the target destination for the link and copy the link information.

   You can use either the fully qualified URL or a relative URL that omits the reference to your store domain.

   | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
   | Full URL     | https://mystore.com/women/tops-women/tees-women.html |
   | Relative URL | ../women/tops-women/tees-women.html                  |

1. Select the text in the editor space and click Insert/edit link (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-add-link.png %})) on the editor toolbar.

   _Adding a link to formatted text_

1. For **Url**, enter the relative link that you prepared.

1. Set **Target** to `None`.

   This setting opens the page in the same browser window, rather than opening a new tab.

1. For **Title**, enter `Shop Tees`.

   The `Title` link attribute is used by some browsers as a tooltip.

1. Click <span class="btn">OK</span> to save the link and return to the Page Builder workspace.

## Insert an image

1. Place the cursor in the text where you want to insert the image.

1. Click Insert/edit image (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-add-image.png %})) on the editor toolbar.

1. For **Source**, click the search icon to use the media storage for locating and selecting an image.

1. For **Image description**, enter descriptive text for the image.

   This populates the `alt` link attribute for the image and is used by some browsers for accessibility.

1. Enter the with and height **Dimensions**, in pixels, for rendering the image on the page.

   Keep the **Constrain proportions** checkbox selected to automatically maintain the aspect ratio for the image.

1. Click <span class="btn">OK</span> to insert the image and then return to the Page Builder workspace.

## Change text settings

1. Hover over the text container to display the toolbox and choose the _Settings_ ( ![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})) icon.

      Enter the corresponding values in the diagram.

      |Margins|The amount of blank space that is applied to the outside edge of all sides of the container. Options: Top / Right / Bottom / Left
