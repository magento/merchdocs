## Add a video

1. Before you begin, navigate to the [YouTube][1] or [Vimeo][2] video that you want to embed, and copy the link.

   As an alternative, you can also copy a direct link to a valid video file. See [Basic video settings](#basic-video-settings) for valid links.

1. In the Magento Admin, return to the Page Builder workspace where you want to add the video.

1. In the Page Builder panel, expand **Media** and drag a **Video** placeholder to the stage.

   The URL of the Page Builder video that is used in this example is: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0KNS7C5dZA`.

1. To limit the **Maximum Width** of the video, enter the maximum width in pixels.

   If blank, the video will be as wide as allowed by the container, less margins and padding.

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Save** to close the _Edit Video_ page and return to the Page Builder workspace.

## Change video settings

1. Hover over the video container to display the toolbox and choose the _Settings_ (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-settings.png %})) icon.

1. Modify the settings according to the following sections:

   - [Basic](#basic-video-settings)
   - [Advanced](#advanced)

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span> in the upper-right corner to close the _Edit Video_ page.

### Basic video settings

1. To change the current video, update the **Video URL**.

   Enter a valid video URL. Valid video URLs can be links to:

   - YouTube videos: `https://youtu.be/CoDhMRUUjeI`
   - Vimeo videos: `https://vimeo.com/190156113`
   - Valid video files (we recommend `.mp4`): `https://myvideos.com/spiral.mp4`

1. To change the width that is allowed for the video in the storefront, enter the new **Maximum Width** in pixels.

   If blank, the video extends the full width of the container, less allowance for margins and padding.

1. To auto-start the video after the page loads, set **Autoplay** to `Yes`.

   If Autoplay is set to `Yes`, the video is muted on playback according to policy. However, even with this setting, mobile devices will not autoplay your videos. For more information about these policies, refer to the following developer resources:

   - [Autoplay policy from Vimeo](https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004485728-Autoplaying-and-looping-embedded-videos)
   - [Autoplay policy from Google (Chrome/YouTube)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes)
   - [Autoplay policy for local videos](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide)

   If Autoplay is set to `No`, the video plays on user demand only.
