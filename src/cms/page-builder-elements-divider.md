Use the Divider content type to add a rule as a visual break between sections of content on the stage. You can specify the line color, thickness, and width of the divider, as well as control the alignment, margins and padding, and format of the container border. By default, the divider is a hairline rule that extends the full width of the container, with allowance for padding.

_Default Divider in Container without Border_

Although most divider containers are invisible, the following example displays the container with a red dashed border so you can see the relationship between the divider, its padding, and the container. You can adjust the padding at the top and bottom of the divider to control the spacing between elements.

## To add a divider

1. In the Page Builder panel under _Elements_, drag a **Divider** placeholder to a row, column, or tab set on the stage.

1. Use the red guideline for reference as you position the divider either before or after another content container on the stage.

   In the following example, the divider marks the beginning of a new section of text.

## To duplicate a divider

For a formatted divider with specific settings, it is more efficient to make a duplicate, rather than start over with a new placeholder.

1. Hover over the container. Then, choose **Duplicate** (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-duplicate.png %}){: .Inline}) in the toolbox.

   The duplicate appears just below the original.
