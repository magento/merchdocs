Content Staging gives your business team the ability to easily create, preview, and schedule a wide range of content updates directly from the Admin of your store. For example, rather than thinking in terms of a static page, consider a page to be a collection of different elements that can be turned "on" or "off" according to schedule. You can use Content Staging to create a page that changes automatically throughout the year on schedule.

The term _campaign_ refers to the record of a scheduled change, or collection of changes, that might be viewed on a calendar or timeline, and managed from the Staging Dashboard. The terms _scheduled change_ and _scheduled update_ are interchangeable and refer to a single change.

When you schedule a content change for a specific period of time, the content reverts to the previous version when the scheduled change expires. You can create multiple versions of the same baseline content to be used for future updates. You can also step back through the timeline to view previous versions of the content. To save a draft version, simply assign a date on the timeline that is so far into the future that it will never go into production.

When any of the following content assets are created, an corresponding campaign is set up as a placeholder, and the Scheduled Changes box appears across the top of the page. The placeholder campaign has a start date, but not an end date. You can schedule updates to the content as part of a campaign, and then preview and share the changes by date, time, or store view.

The Staging Dashboard provides visibility into all planned site changes and updates. Any day, range of dates, or time period of a campaign can be previewed, and shared with others.
