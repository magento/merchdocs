title: Using Adobe Stock Images
---

[Adobe Stock][adobe-stock] images can be used in place of uploading your own image content. One common use case is, when creating a new page, it is desirable to upload and place image content.

The new [Media Gallery]({% link cms/media-gallery.md %}) provides a direct integration with Adobe Stock, making it easy to license your images directly from the gallery page.

## Access the Adobe Stock search grid

The Adobe Stock search panel is accessible when you [add or edit a page]({% link cms/page-add.md %}), when you [create or edit a category]({% link catalog/category-create.md %}), or when you [insert images via the Content Editor]({% link cms/editor-insert-image.md %}).

## Filter and search for Adobe Stock assets

The [Adobe Stock Search Grid][access-search] provides querying and filtering functionality to help you find the perfect image for your Magento stores.

searching the millions of assets available via Adobe Stock.

### Search for Adobe Stock assets by keywords

1. Enter your keyword search into the **Search by keyword** input field in the top-left and click the magnifying glass or press **Enter**.

### Save images to the Media Storage

Images searched using the Adobe Stock integration can be saved to the Magento [Media Storage][media-storage] for easy re-use across your Magento store.

You can save two types of images: an [image preview][save-preview] or a [licensed image][save-licensed].

#### Save an image preview

An image preview is a watermarked version of an Adobe Stock asset. Image previews are free and are a good way to experiment with different images before you decide to purchase a license for specific images and use them on your production stores.

1. Click an image in the search grid in order to [view the image details][view-details].

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Preview</span>.

    ![Save Adobe Stock preview image]({% link images/images/adobe-stock/save-preview.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Save the preview image_

1. Click <span class="btn">Confirm</span>.

    The page redirects to the [Media Storage][media-storage] and your saved preview is displayed.

#### Save a licensed image

Adobe Stock assets that you want to use for your production Magento stores should be licensed to ensure you have legal access to the image as well as to eliminate the Adobe Stock watermark that is present on all [image previews][save-preview]. To license images or to save already-licensed images, you must be logged in to your Adobe account.

1. [Log in to your Adobe account][log-in-to-adobe-account].

1. Click an image in the search grid in order to [view the image details][view-details].

1. Depending on the current licensing status of the image, do one of the following:

   - If the image is already licensed, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

   - If the image is _not_ licensed, click <span class="btn">License and Save</span>.

      {:.bs-callout-info}
      You must have available [Adobe Stock credits][stock-credits] in your account to license the image.

   This displays a prompt for you to specify a file name that is used to save the image to the [Media Storage][media-storage]. A default file name is provided, but you can customize the name to your preferences.

   ![Save Adobe Stock licensed image]({% link images/images/adobe-stock/save-licensed.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Save the licensed image_

1. Click <span class="btn">Confirm</span>.
