title: Duplicating and Deleting a Page
---

Any content page can be used as a template, and saved as a duplicate. You might use this time-saving technique to create a consistent design for content pages throughout your site. The duplicate page retains the Page Title of the original, but the URL Key and Status fields must be updated.
