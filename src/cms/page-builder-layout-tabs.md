title: Layout - Tabs
---

Use the _Tabs_ content type to add a set of tabs in the [Page Builder stage]({% link cms/page-builder-workspace.md %}#stage). When you drag the Tabs placeholder from the panel to the stage, a single default tab initially appears. You can add more tabs as needed to create a full set. The width of the tab set is determined by the width of its parent container and padding settings.

### Background

- **Background Color** - Specify the background color by choosing a swatch, clicking the color picker, or by entering a valid color name or equivalent hexadecimal value. This determines the background color of the row. You can also adjust the opacity of the color.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-settings-background-color-no-color.png %}){: .zoom}
   _No color (default)_

   You can enter a value in three ways:

   - A predefined color name, such as `White`

   - The hexadecimal color value for the color, such as `#ffffff`

   - The rgba value for the color, with opacity percent, such as `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75)`

   If you want to choose a color, click the swatch to the left of the _No Color_ box.

   ![]({% link images/images-ee/page-builder-settings-background-color-picker-swatch.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Choosing a color swatch_

   If you click the color box to open the color picker again, the box below the slider shows the current red, green, blue, and alpha values (rgba). The last number indicates the current opacity percentage as a decimal. You can use the slider to adjust the opacity, or enter the desired decimal value.

   |![Camera icon]({{site.baseurl}}/images/images-ee/icon-pb-camera.png){: width="25px"}|Allows you to either drag the image to the camera tile or browse to the image in your local file system.

- **Background Mobile Image** - If needed, use the same tools to choose a different background image to be used for display on mobile devices.
