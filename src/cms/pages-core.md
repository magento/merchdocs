title: Core Content
---

The Commerce demo store has examples of core content pages to help you get started. All of the pages can be modified to meet your needs. Take a look at the following pages in your store to make sure that the content conveys your message, voice, and brand.

## Home

The demo [Home]({% link quick-tour/home-page.md %}) page includes a banner, an image carousel, several static blocks with links, and a list of new products.

## Privacy Policy

The store [Privacy Policy]({% link stores/privacy-policy.md %}) page should be updated with your own information. As a best practice, your privacy policy should explain to your customers the type of information that your company collects and how it is used.

## 404 Not Found

The [404 Page Not Found]({% link cms/pages-default.md %}) page is named for the response code that is returned when a page cannot be found. URL redirects reduce the number of times that this page appears. However, for those times when it is necessary, you might as well take advantage of the opportunity to offer some links to products that the customer might find interesting.

## Access Denied

The [Access Denied]({% link customers/account-company-roles-permissions.md %}) page appears when the permissions that are assigned to a company user prevent access to the page.

## Enable Cookies

The [Enable Cookies]({% link stores/compliance-cookie-law.md %}) page appears when visitors to your site do not have cookies enabled in their browsers. The page provides step-by-step, illustrated instructions to enable cookies for the most popular browsers.

## Service Unavailable

The [503 Service Unavailable]({% link configuration/general/general.md %}) page is named for the response code that is returned when the server is unavailable.

## About Us

The About Us page is linked from the footer of your store. You can include images, video, links to press releases and announcements. The sample page has an image on the right, and decorative one to indicate the end of the page.

## Customer Service

The Customer Service page is another node in the page hierarchy. The two headers on the page have content that only becomes visible when the customer clicks the header.
