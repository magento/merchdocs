title: Payouts
---

Payouts shows comprehensive payout information at-a-glance, allowing you full transparency into the payment amount, processed volume, and detailed reporting on the transaction level for financial reconciliation.

You don't have to open multiple dashboards or views to cross-reference orders and payments or reconcile accounts. Magento Payments enables you to take all these actions from one place---Payouts---so that you can view and manage your payouts efficiently.

See linked Magento order and transaction IDs, transaction amounts, payment method per transaction, and more, all within Payouts in the Admin.

You can download payout transactions in a .csv file format for use in existing accounting or order management software.

## Availability

On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > **Magento Payments** > **Payouts**.
