title: Vertex Customer Exceptions
---

Under certain circumstances, customers who are normally required to pay taxes might be certified as exempt. The available exceptions vary, depending on the jurisdiction.

The Customer Exceptions configuration can be used to set up individual customer exceptions, or to upload multiple exceptions from a [CSV file]({% link system/data-csv.md %}). The Customers grid lists all exception certificates currently on file per customer.

Only customers with non-standard tax requirements are added to Vertex Cloud. The standard jurisdiction tax rates are used for all other customers.

_Customer Exceptions_

## Before you begin

Vertex Cloud adds the Vertex Customer Code field to the customer information. Customer exceptions can be based on either the Vertex Customer Code field in the customer account, or on the tax class that is associated with the customer group to which the customer belongs.

1. To assign the Vertex Customer Code to a customer, open the customer account in edit mode.

   See [Managing Customer Accounts]({% link customers/customer-account-manage.md %}) for more information.

1. Under _Account Information_, scroll down to the **Vertex Customer Code** field at the bottom of the section.

1. Enter a unique code to identify the customer.

   The code can be an abbreviation of the customer name, number, or alphanumeric string.

1. If you need to add new customer tax classes to Magento, see [Adding New Tax Classes]({% link tax/tax-class-new.md %}).

1. If you need to add new customer groups to Magento, see [Customer Groups]({% link customers/customer-groups.md %}).
