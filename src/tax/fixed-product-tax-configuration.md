title: Configuring FPT
---

The Fixed Product Tax [input type]({% link stores/attributes-input-types.md %}) creates a section of fields for managing tax for each region.

The following instructions show how to set up a fixed product tax for your store, using “eco tax” as an example. After setting the scope for the tax and the countries and states where the tax applies, and depending on the options you choose, the input fields can change according to the local requirements. To learn more, see [Creating Attributes]({% link stores/attribute-product-create.md %}).

## Step 1: Enable Fixed Product Tax

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the panel on the left under _Sales_, choose **Tax**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Fixed Product Taxes** section.

1. Set **Enable FPT** to `Yes`.

1. To determine how fixed product taxes are used in store prices, choose the FPT setting for each of the following price display locations:

    - **Display Prices in Product Lists**
    - **Display Prices on Product View Page**
    - **Display Prices in Sales Modules**
    - **Display Prices in Emails**.

    Options (same for each)

    - `Including FPT Only`
    - `Including FPT and FPT description`
    - `Excluding FPT. Including FPT description and final price`
    - `Excluding FPT`

## Step 2: Create an FPT Attribute

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Advanced Attribute Properties** section. Then, do the following:

    - **Attribute Code** — Enter a unique identifier in lowercase, without spaces or special characters. The maximum length is 30 characters. You can leave the field blank to the text from the Default Label field.

    - **Add to Column Options** — If you want the FPT field to appear in the Inventory [grid]({% link catalog/products.md %}), set to `Yes`.

    - **Use in Filter Options** — If you want to be able to [filter]({% link stores/admin-workspace.md %}) products in the grid based on the value of the FPT field, set to `Yes`.

1. Drag the FPT attribute from the list of **Unassigned Attributes** on the right to the **Groups** list in the center column.

    Each group folder corresponds to a section of product information. You can place the attribute wherever you want it to appear when the product is open in edit mode.
