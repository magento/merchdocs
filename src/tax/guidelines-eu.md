The following example depicts a store based in France that sells 100k+ Euros in France and 100k+ Euros in Germany.

- Tax calculations are managed at the website level.
- Currency conversion and tax display options are controlled individually at the store view level (Select the Use Website checkbox to override the default).
- By setting the default tax country you can dynamically show the correct tax for the jurisdiction.
- Fixed product tax is included for relevant goods as a product attribute.
- It might be necessary to edit the catalog to ensure that it shows up in the correct category/website/store view.

## Step 1: Create three product tax classes

For this example, it is assumed that multiple VAT-Reduced product tax classes are not needed.
