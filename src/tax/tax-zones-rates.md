title: Tax Zones and Rates
---

Tax rates generally apply to transactions that take place within a specific geographical area. The Tax Zones and Rates tool enables you to specify the tax rate for each geographical area from which you collect and remit taxes. Because each tax zone and rate has a unique identifier, you can have multiple tax rates for a given geographic area (such as places that do not tax food or medicine, but do tax other items).

Store tax is calculated based on the store’s address. The actual customer tax for an order is calculated after the customer completes the order information. Magento then calculates the tax based upon the tax configuration of the store.

## Define a new tax rate

1. Enter a **Tax Identifier**.

1. To apply the tax rate to a single ZIP or postal code, enter the code for **Zip/Post Code**.

   The asterisk wildcard (`*`) can be used to match up to ten characters in the code. For example, `90*` represents all ZIP codes from 90000 through 90999.

1. To apply the tax rate to a range of ZIP or postal codes, do the following:

   - Select the **Zip/Post is Range** checkbox and define the range by entering the first and last ZIP or postal code for **Range From** and **Range To**.
