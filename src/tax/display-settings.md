title: Price Display Settings
---

The price display settings determine if product and shipping prices include or exclude tax, or show two versions of the price; one with, and the other without tax.

If the product price includes tax, the tax appears only if there is a tax rule that matches the tax origin or if a customer address matches the tax rule. Events that can trigger a match include when a customer creates an account, logs in, or generates a tax and shipping estimate from the shopping cart.

**Important!**
Showing prices that include and exclude tax can be confusing to the customer. To avoid triggering a warning message, see the [guidelines]({% link tax/international-tax-guidelines.md %}) for your country and [recommended settings]({% link tax/warning-messages.md %}) to avoid warning messages.
