title: Canadian Tax Guidelines
---

The following example shows how to set up GST tax rates for Canada and PST tax rates for Saskatchewan, with tax rules that calculate and display the two tax rates. Because this is an example configuration, be sure to verify the correct tax rates and rules for your tax jurisdictions. When setting up taxes, set the store scope to apply the configuration to all applicable stores and websites.

- Fixed product tax is included for relevant goods as a product attribute.
- In Quebec, PST is referred to as TVQ. If you need to set up a rate for Quebec, make sure to use TVQ as the identifier.
