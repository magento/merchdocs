Some countries charge a value-added tax, or VAT, on goods and services. There can be different VAT rates depending on the stage in the manufacture or distribution process, materials, or services that you sell to your customers. In some cases, you might need to apply more than one VAT rate to correctly calculate the tax that is due.

Commerce can be configured to charge a value-added tax based on either the merchant or customer address, provided that both are located in the same country. VAT calculations are usually based on the shipment destination, rather than its point of origin. For most scenarios, a configuration setting that calculates VAT based on the customer shipping address is sufficient.

## Example scenarios

- For a VAT registered business in one EU country that supplies goods to a private individual in another EU country, VAT is calculated as a "distance sale" based on merchant location.

- A business in the Netherlands that makes a purchase from a store in the U.K. that ships to an address in the U.K. is required to pay U.K. VAT rates.

- For the sale of [downloadable products]({% link catalog/product-create-downloadable.md %}), or _digital goods_, the VAT rate is based on the shipping destination, rather than the merchant location. See [EU Place of Supply for Digital Goods]({% link tax/eu-place-of-supply.md %}).

## More complex requirements

Some cross-border and B2B shipments have more complex tax requirements. To expand the native capabilities of your Commerce installation, consider adding a tax management solution from [Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions/accounting-finance/taxes.html).
