title: Warning Messages
---

Some combinations of tax-related options might be confusing to customers and trigger a warning. These conditions might occur when the tax calculation method is set to `Row` or `Total`, and the customer is presented with prices that both exclude and include tax, or a tax on an item basis in the cart. Because the tax calculation is rounded, the amount that appears in the cart might differ from the amount that a customer expects to pay.

If your tax calculation is based on a problematic configuration, the following warnings appear:

![]({% link images/images/icon-warning.png %}) **Warning**. Tax discount configuration might result in different discounts than a customer might expect for store(s); Europe Website (French), Europe Website (German). Please see source for more details.

![]({% link images/images/icon-warning.png %}) **Warning**. Tax configuration can result in rounding errors for store(s): Europe Websites (French), Europe Websites (German).
