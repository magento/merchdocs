title: Vertex Products
---

Products with tax exceptions can be entered individually through your Vertex dashboard, or uploaded from a [CSV file]({% link system/data-csv.md %}) to Vertex Cloud. Each product is then mapped to appropriate tax category in the Vertex tax code hierarchy. Vertex Cloud uses a product’s tax category to apply the current rate and rule changes that are mandated by each jurisdiction.

The product table in your dashboard lists all products that have been entered into Vertex Cloud for the company.

## Before you begin

Magento assigns tax classes to individual SKUs through the associated _Tax Class_ field in the product information.

1. Make sure that you have all the information that you need.

   Products must be completely configured before the information can be saved.

1. If needed, add new product tax classes to Magento.

   See [Adding New Tax Classes]({% link tax/tax-class-new.md %}) for more information.

1. Assign the new tax classes to products:

   - Open the [product]({% link catalog/products.md %}) in edit mode.
   - Set **Tax Class** as needed.
   - When complete, click **Save**.

1. To ensure accuracy, prepare a worksheet that includes the following for each product:

   - SKU
   - Product Name
   - Tax Class
   - Company Start and End Date

1. Prepare your upload data.

   The easiest way to prepare your upload data is to export the products from your Magento catalog to a CSV file. If you need more information, see [Export]({% link system/data-export.md %}).

1. After the export, open the file in a spreadsheet, and delete all columns except for the following:

   |`sku`|The SKU that is assigned to the product in your Magento catalog.|
   |`product_type`|(For reference only) Use the `product_type` column for reference if your catalog includes virtual products that are taxed as digital goods.|
   |`categories`|(For reference only) Include the categories column for reference when assigning the tax categories.|
   |`name`|The product name that is associated with the SKU.|
   |`tax_class_name`|The Tax Class that is assigned to the SKU. For example: Taxable Goods|

1. In the spreadsheet, sort the data by the categories column. If you use Microsoft Excel, do the following:

   - Click the upper-left corner to select the entire worksheet.

   - On the _Data_ menu, choose **Sort**.

   - Select the **My data has headers** checkbox. Then under _Column_, set **Sort by** to `categories`.

   - Click **OK** to sort the data.

   - The products are now sorted in a way that makes it easy to group by tax category.

   - **Save** the file, but keep it open because you will need it in the next step.

## Add a single product

In the sidebar, choose **Configure**. Then in the **Products** column of the company section, click **Add**.

_Products_

### Step 1: Complete the Product Information

1. On the **Add Single Product** tab, complete the following product information:

   ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-products-add-single.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Add Single Product_

1. Set **Tax Type** to one of the following:

   - `Consumer Use Tax`
   - `Sales/Seller’s Use Tax`

1. Set **Code / Class Type** to the code that identifies the way the product, material, or service is used.

1. For **Code / Class**, enter the product **SKU** exactly as it appears in your Magento catalog.

1. Enter the **Product Name**.

1. Use the calendar to choose the **Start Date** that the product becomes available to Vertex Cloud.

   If applicable, choose the **End Date** that the product is no longer available.

### Step 2: Map Each Product

In this step, each product is mapped to the appropriate tax category. Tax categories can be mapped to a granular level for individual products. See the [Vertex Tax Codes][1] reference.

1. Under **Product Mapping**, choose the applicable tax category.

   In the beginning, the options are:

   - General
   - Manufacturing

   For this example, the General tax category applies to an item of clothing from the Luma demo catalog.

   _Product Mapping_

1. Choose the tax category for the next level from the following options:

   - Services
   - TPP/Goods

   For this example, TTP/Goods applies to the product.

   ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-product-mapping-tpp-goods.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Mapping to TPP/Goods Tax Category_

1. Choose the tax category from the next level in the list that applies to the product.

   ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-product-mapping-clothing.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Mapping to Clothing Tax Category_

1. Continue to assign tax categories, as long as there is an applicable option.

   See the **Category Description** below the mapping for more information about the current tax category.

   For this example, Clothing is the last tax category that applies to the product.

### Step 3: Add Any Qualifying Conditions

Some states have qualifying conditions that might apply to various items in the tax category.

1. Click **Add Qualifying Condition**.

   ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-product-qualifying-conditions.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Qualifying Conditions_

1. Under _Jurisdiction_, choose the **State** where the qualifying condition applies.

1. Under _Imposition Type_, choose the option that applies to the item.

   For this example, “General Sales and Use Tax” is the only available option.

1. Under _Qualifying Condition_, select each condition that applies to the item.

   ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-product-qualifying-conditions-complete.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Qualifying Conditions_

1. To add another condition, click **Add Qualifying Condition**.

   Then, repeat the process.

1. When complete, click **Save & Close** or click **Save & Add Another**.

## Upload multiple products

1. Log in to your **Vertex Cloud** account.

1. In the sidebar, choose **Configure**.

1. On the _Configure Overview_ page, in the _Products_ column of the company section, click **Add**.

1. Choose the **Upload Multiple Products** tab and click **Download File Format Template**.

    ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-product-upload-multiple.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Upload Multiple Products_

1. Look for the `ProductsSample.csv` file at the bottom of the browser window and open the file in your spreadsheet.

   ![]({% link images/images/tax-vertex-cloud-configure-product-upload-data.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Upload Template_

   **Column Descriptions:**

   Column name | Description
   ----------- | -----------
   Results | A message that indicates that the upload was either a success, or encountered an error.
   Code Or Class | The SKU that is assigned to the product in Magento. Maximum size: 40 characters
   Product Name | The product name that is associated with the SKU. Maximum size: 60 characters
   Tax Type | Identifies the type of use tax as one of the following:<br/>**Buy** - The tax type for consumer use tax.<br/>**Sell** — The tax ype for sales/seller use tax.
   Code or Class Type | This value depends on the Buy/Sell tax type. The data is passed by Magento to Vertex Cloud, and drives the tax calculation. For example, the following values are valid for sellers:<br>**Product Class** - A high-level group of products, materials, or SKUs that have the same tax setting.<br/>**Product Code** - A specific product, material, service, or SKU.<br>**FlexCode03** to **FlexCode07** — User-definable codes.<br>For a complete list of Buy/Sell options, see the [Products File Layout](https://helpcenter.vertexsmb.com/docs/company-configuration/products/products-file-layout/) reference.
   Start Date | Determines the date that the product becomes available to Vertex Cloud. The Start Date must be on or after the company start date. Leave blank to use the company start date as the default. Format: `MM/DD/YYYY`
   End Date | Determines the date that the product is no longer available to Vertex Cloud. This date must be on or after the company start date. Format: `MM/DD/YYYY`
   Vertex Tax Code | The code, rather than the name, of the applicable tax category in the Vertex product hierarchy. For example:<br/>`VTX04-00143` — The code for “Clothing.”<br/>For a complete list of valid codes, see the [Vertex Tax Code](https://helpcenter.vertexsmb.com/docs/company-configuration/products/vertex-tax-codes/) reference.
   Notes | (Optional) Miscellaneous notes about the product for your reference. Notes are not stored in Vertex Cloud.

1. Continue to prepare the data.

### Step 1: Prepare the Data

In this step, columns of data are pasted from the CSV file that you exported to the `ProductsSample.csv` template. To make it easy, open each file in a different window of your spreadsheet application. Then, paste each applicable column of data into the template.

1. Code or class data

   - In the exported data, copy the entire `sku` column
   - In the template, paste the data over the `Code Or Class` column.
   - Enter the correct column name, **Code or Class** over the `sku` header.

1. Name data

   - In the exported data, copy the entire `name` column.
   - In the template, paste the data over the `Product Name` column.
   - Enter the correct column name, **Product Name** over the `name` header.

1. Tax class data

   - In the exported data, copy the entire `tax_class_name` column.
   - In the template, paste the data over the `Code or Class Type` column.
   - Enter the correct column name, **Code or Class Type** over the `tax_class_name` header.

1. Tax type data

   The value of the Tax Type column is either “Buy” or “Sell,” depending on the tax scenario. In this context, each of the products is to be sold.

   - Enter the word “Sell” into the first cell below the `Tax Type` column header.
   - Copy the value and paste it to the entire range of active cells in the column.

1. Dates

   - To use the default **Start Date** and **End Date** for the company, leave these fields blank.
   - Enter a different **Start Date** and/or **End Date** for any product, enter the dates in MM/DD/YYYY format.

1. Vertex tax codes

   To determine the correct **Vertex Tax Code**, see the [Vertex Tax Codes][1] reference. Then, enter the tax codes for each product.

   This is where having the data sorted by category helps, because it groups products of a similar type together.

   In this example, the data includes clothing, sports gear,{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %} gift cards,{% endif %} and downloadable videos. Because there is not a code available at this level for sports gear, you can leave those records blank, and complete them later in Vertex Cloud.

   |Clothing|`VTX04-00143`
   |Digital Goods|`VTX04-00544`<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
   |Gift Certificate/Cards|`VTX04-02252`<!--{% endif %}-->
   |Gear| --

   Products that are uploaded without a tax category can later be assigned manually to the appropriate tax category at a more granular level.

1. When the template is ready to upload, save the CSV file.

### Step 2: Upload the data

1. To upload the completed template, click **Browse**.

1. Navigate to the file on your computer, and click **Upload File**.

## Copy company products

If you have multiple companies with the same or similar catalog, you can copy the uploaded data from one company to another. Then, make any changes necessary. See [Copy Products From One Company to Another Company][2] in the Vertex Cloud Help Center.
