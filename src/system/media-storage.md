Commerce gives you the option to store media files in a database on a database server, or on a Content Delivery Network (CDN), as opposed to storing them on the file system of the web server. The advantage of using alternate storage is that it minimizes the effort required to synchronize media when multiple instances of the system that are deployed on different servers that need access to the same images, CSS files, and other media files.
