Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source perform some operations on schedule by periodically running a script. You can control the execution and scheduling of Commerce cron jobs from the Admin. Store operations that run according to a cron schedule include, but are not limited to:

- [Email ]({% link marketing/communications.md %})
- [Catalog Price Rules]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %})
- [Newsletters]({% link marketing/newsletters.md %})
- [XMLÂ Sitemap Generation]({% link marketing/sitemap-xml.md %})
- [Currency Rate Updates]({% link stores/currency-update.md %})
- [Inventory Management]({% link catalog/inventory-management.md %})

Commerce services must be installed in crontab in order for core components, as well as some third-party extensions, to function as expected.
See the [instructions in the Installation Guide]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/guides/v2.4/install-gde/install/post-install-config.html) for detailed information about installing services to crontab.

In addition, you can configure the following to run according to a cron schedule:

- Order System Grid Updates and Reindexing
- Pending Payment Lifetime

Make sure that the [base URLs]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}) for the store are set correctly, so the URLs that are generated during cron operations are correct. For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, see [Set up cron jobs][1]{:target="_blank"} in the Commerce Developer Guide. For on-premise, see [Configure and run con][2]{:target="_blank"} in the Commerce Developer Guide.
