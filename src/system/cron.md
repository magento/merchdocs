title: Cron (Scheduled Tasks)
---

Magento performs some operations on schedule by periodically running a script. You can control the execution and scheduling of Magento cron jobs from the Admin. Store operations that run according to a cron schedule include:

- [Email ]({% link marketing/communications.md %})
- [Catalog Price Rules]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %})
- [Newsletters]({% link marketing/newsletters.md %})
- [XMLÂ Sitemap Generation]({% link marketing/sitemap-xml.md %})
- [Currency Rate Updates]({% link stores/currency-update.md %})

In addition, you can configure the following to run according to a cron schedule:

- Order System Grid Updates and Reindexing
- Pending Payment Lifetime

Make sure that the [base URLs]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}) for the store are set correctly, so the URLs that are generated during cron operations are correct. See [Set up cron jobs][1]{:target="_blank"} in the developer documentation.

1. Complete the following settings for the **Index** and **Default** groups.

   The settings are the same in each section.

    |**Generate Schedules Every**|Defines how often the schedule is generated (in minutes). Schedules are stored in the database.|
