title: Frontend Development Workflow
---

The Frontend Development Workflow type determines if Less compilation takes place on the client- or server side during development. Less is an extension of CSS that has additional features and conventions, and that produces streamlined code. Client-side Less compilation is recommended for theme development. Server-side compilation is the default mode. The development workflow options are not available for stores in production mode.
See [Client-side LESS compilation vs. server-side][1]{:target="_blank"} in the developer documentation.
