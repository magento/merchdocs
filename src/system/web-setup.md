Web Setup is the second part of the Magento installation that checks system readiness, establishes the database connection, and creates the initial Admin account. The following steps give an overview of the process that takes place at the end of the installation.

## Step 1: Readiness Check

To verify that your system meets the system requirements, tap <span class="btn"> Start Readiness Check </span>.

When the results appear, tap **Details** for more information. Then, do one of the following;

* If your system fails the readiness check, correct the issue and tap <span class="btn"> Try Again </span>.
* If your system meets the requirements, tap <span class="btn"> Next </span>.

Enter the **Database Server Username**.

Enter the **Database Server Password**.

Enter the **Database Name**.

If applicable, enter the **Table prefix**.

When complete, tap <span class="btn">Next </span> . Your credentials must be correct to continue to the next step.

When the installation completes, a page appears with your Magento Admin and database credentials, but without the passwords. You can print the page and keep it for your records. Then, do of the following:

[Flush the cache]({% link system/cache-management.md %}) and [reindex]({% link system/index-management.md %}) after installing Magento.

## A little Housekeeping

After Setup is complete, do the following to set the recommended permissions for all files and folders in your Magento 2 installation. These instructions require using the command line which may need developer assistance.

To learn more, see [File systems access permissions][2]{: target="_blank"}.

Change to the Web user who has full permissions to the Magento2 folder. (For example, apache or root.)

```bash
su – apache
```

Change directories to the Magento2 folder, and set the following permissions. You can copy the code, and paste it as a single command.

```bash
find . -type d -exec chmod 700 {} ; && find . -type f -exec chmod 600 {} ; && chmod +x bin/magento
```
