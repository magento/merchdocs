The Mail Sending Settings give you the ability to route returned email or replies to email to a specific address. Also, if your store is running on a Windows server, you can verify the host and port settings.

**Security Notice!** We recommend that all merchants immediately set their mail sending configuration to protect against a recently identified potential remote code execution exploit. Until this issue is resolved, we highly recommend that you avoid using [Sendmail][1] for email communications. In the Mail Sending Settings, make sure that Set Return Path is set to `No`. To learn more, see the [Commerce Security Center posting][2]{:target="_blank"}.

    - If running on a Windows server, verify the following settings:

        | Host | localhost |

    - Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the **General Settings** section.

    - Set **Asynchronous sending** to `Enable`.
