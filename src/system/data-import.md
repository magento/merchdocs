Data for all product types can be imported into the store. In addition, you can import products, advanced pricing data, customer data, customer address data, and product images. Import supports the following operations:

- Add/Update
- Replace
- Delete

The size of the import file is determined by the settings in the `php.ini` file on the server. The system message on the _Import_ page indicates the current size limit. The default size is 2MB.

Special characters (such as the equal sign, greater and less than symbols, single and double quotes, backslash, pipe, and ampersand symbols) can cause problems during data transfer. To ensure that such special characters are correctly interpreted, they can be marked as an _escape sequence_. For example, if the data includes a string of text such as `code=”str”`, `code=”str2”`, choosing to enclose the text in double quotes ensures that the original double quotes are understood to be part of the data. When the system encounters a double set of double quotes, it understands that the outer set of double quotes is enclosing the actual data.

When importing product data, new product data is added to existing product data entries in the database. All fields except SKU can be updated through import. All existing product data is replaced with the imported new data. Exercise caution when replacing data. All existing product data will be completely cleared and all references in the system will be lost.

_Import_

## Step 1: Prepare the Data

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **System** > _Data Transfer_ > **Import**.

1. Under _Import Settings_, set **Entity Type** to one of the following:

   - `Advanced Pricing`
   - `Products`
   - `Customers and Addresses`
   - `Customers Main File`
   - `Customer Addresses`

1. Click **Download Sample File**.

1. Locate the export file at the downloads location for your web browser and open the file.

    ![Open download sample file]({% link images/images/data-import-download-sample-file.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Open Download Sample File_

    The sample file includes column headings with placeholder data for example product types.

    ![Import data sample file]({% link images/images/data-export-sample-data.png %}){: .zoom}
    _View Sample File_

1. Examine the structure of the sample file and use it to prepare your CSV import file, making sure that the column headings are spelled correctly.

1. Verify that the size of your import file does not exceed the limit shown in the message.

    ![Data import size notification]({% link images/images/data-import-size-notification.png %}){: .zoom}

1. If the import data includes paths to product images, make sure that the image files have been uploaded to the appropriate location.

   The default location on the Magento server is: `pub/media/import`.

    If the images reside on an external server, make sure that you have the full URL to the directory that contains the images.

## Step 2: Choose the Import Behavior

1. Set **Import Behavior** to one of the following:

   - `Add/Update` (For products, you can update all fields except SKU through import.)
   - `Replace`
   - `Delete`

1. To determine what happens when an error is encountered when importing data, choose one of the following:

   - `Stop on Error`
   - `Skip error entries`

1. In the **Allowed Errors Count** field, enter the number of errors that can occur before the import is canceled.

   The default value is 10.

1. Accept the default value of a comma (`,`) for the **Field separator**.

1. Accept the default value of a comma (`,`) for the **Multiple value separator**.

    In a CSV file, a comma is the default separator. To use a different character, make sure that the data in the CSV file matches the character that you specify.

1. If you want to enclose any special characters that might be found in the data as an _escape sequence_, select the **Fields Enclosure** checkbox.

    _Import Behavior_

## Step 3: Identify the Import File

1. Click **Choose File** to select the file to import.

1. Find the CSV file that you prepared to import and click **Open**.

1. In the **Images File Directory** field, enter the relative path to the location on the Magento server where uploaded images are stored.

   For example: `product_images`.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Starting with the Magento `2.3.2` release, the path specified in the **Images File Directory** concatenates for import to the images base directory: `<Magento-root-folder>/var/import/images`. For example, place the `product_images` files in the `<Magento-root-directory>/var/import/images/product_images` folder. The import images base directory can be configured in the `\Magento\ImportExport\etc\config.xml` file. If the Remote storage module is enabled, import files to the `<remote-storage-root-directory>/var/import/images/product_images` folder.

   To learn more about importing product images, see [Importing Product Images]({% link system/data-import-product-images.md %}).

    _File to Import_

## Step 4: Check the Import Data

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Check Data**.

1. Wait a few moments for the validation process to complete.

   If the import data is valid, the following message appears:

    ![Success message - file is valid]({% link images/images/data-import-validation-message.png %}){: .zoom}
    _File is Valid_

1. If the file is valid, click **Import**.

   Otherwise, correct each problem with the data that is listed in the message, and try to import the file again.

1. The import process continues to the end of the data, unless an error is encountered.

    If an error message appears in the Validation Results, correct the problem in the data and import the file again.

    ![Error message - URL key already exists]({% link images/images/data-import-validation-error-url-key-exists.png %}){: .zoom}
    _URL Key Already Exists_

    A message appears when the import is complete.
