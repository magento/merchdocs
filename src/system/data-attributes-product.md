title: Product Export Attributes Reference

---

The following table lists the attributes from a typical product export, in the default order in which they appear. Each attribute is represented in the CSV file as a column, and product records are represented by rows. Columns that begin with an underscore contain service data such as properties or option values for complex data. You can [export]({% link system/data-export.md %}) a product from your catalog, to see how each attribute is represented in the data.

The installation used to export this data has the sample data installed, and has two websites and several store views. Although this list includes all columns that are typically exported, the `sku` is the only required value. To import data, you can include only the columns with changes. The `sku` should be the first column, but the order of the rest of the attributes doesn't matter.

## Simple Product CSV File Structure

|Attribute|Description|
|--- |--- |
|sku|(Required) The Stock-Keeping Unit is a unique, alphanumeric identifier that is used to track inventory. A SKU can be up to 64 characters in length. For example: `sku123`<br/>**_Note:_** A SKU longer than 64 characters causes import to fail.|
|store_view_code|Identifies the specific store view(s) where the product is available. If blank, the product is available at the default store view. For example: `storeview1`, `english`, `spanish`|
|attribute_set_code|Assigns the product to a specific attribute set or product template, according to product type. Once the product is created, the attribute set cannot be changed. For example: `default`|
|product_type|Indicates the type of product. Values:<br/>**simple** — Tangible items that are generally sold as single units or in fixed quantities.<br/>**grouped** — A group of separate products that is sold as a set.<br/>**configurable** — A product with multiple options that the customer must select before making a purchase. Inventory can be managed for each set of variations because they represent a separate product with a distinct SKU. For example, a combination of color and size for a configurable product is associated with a specific SKU in the catalog.<br/>**virtual** — A non-tangible product that does not require shipping and is not kept in inventory. Examples include services, memberships, and subscriptions.<br/>**bundle** — A customizable product set  of simple products that are sold together.|
