title: Importing Bundle Products
---

A bundle product presents a selection of items and allows customers to choose the ones they want to purchase. All items that make up a bundle already exist in the catalog as either [Simple Products]({% link catalog/product-create-simple.md %}) or [Virtual Products]({% link catalog/product-create-virtual.md %}). Bundle products are usually created and updated from the Admin. However, you can also import data to create a new bundle product or you can export existing bundle products, edit the data, and import them back into the catalog. The Sprite Yoga Companion Kit is a bundle product in the sample data that is used in the following examples.

_Bundle Product_

## Change the order of bundle items

There are two ways to change the order of items in a bundle product.

### Method 1: Drag and drop

When working with a [Bundle]({% link catalog/product-create-bundle.md %}) product from the Admin, you can drag and drop items and sections into position.

### Method 2: Edit the product data

The best way to understand how a bundle product is structured is to export the product and examine the data in a spreadsheet.  You can change the order of bundle items by exporting the product and adding a position parameter to the data for each item. The item data are located in the `bundle_values` column of the exported product. When opened in a spreadsheet, all of the items associated with the product are located in a single cell as a long string of text. The `bundle_values` column contains the following elements for each item:

- Name of the item section
- Input control
- Required item indicator
- SKU
- Color
- Price
- Default option indicator
- Default quantity
- Price type
- Quantity editable indicator

#### Step 1: Export the bundle product

In this step, the Sprite Yoga Companion Kit is exported as a ([CSV]({% link system/data-csv.md %})) file. You can use any other bundle product that you have in your catalog.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **System** > _Data Transfer_ > **Export**.

1. Under _Export Settings_, set **Entity Type** to `Products`.

1. In the list of product attributes, scroll down to **SKU** and enter the SKU of the bundle product that you want to export.

   The SKU is `24-WG080` for the product in this example.

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the section and click <span class="btn">Continue</span>.

1. In the **Action** column of the _File name_ grid, click **Select** and choose `Download`.

    The file appears in the download location used by your browser.

#### Step 2: Edit the data

1. Open the downloaded CSV file in a spreadsheet.

1. Scroll to the far right, until you can see the `bundle_values` column.

   In the `bundle_values` data, each element is separated by comma, and each bundle item is separated from the next with a vertical bar. (The last item does not end with a vertical bar.) Your exported bundle data should look similar to the following example:

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-values-export-data.png
     %}){: .zoom}
    _Bundle Values_

1. To make it easier to edit, you can copy the `bundle_values` data, and paste it into a text editor, Then, add a line break after each item, so each item is on a separate line.

1. After editing the data, carefully remove the line breaks and paste the edited data back into the `bundle_values` column.

   In the following illustration, a `position=[number]` parameter is added to each yoga strap to change the order of the items in the store listing.

   ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-values-position-parameter.png%}){: .zoom}
   _Position Parameter_

1. After editing the data, **Save** the CSV file.

#### Step 3: Import the updated product

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **System** > _Data Transfer_ > **Import**.

1. Under **Import Settings**, set **Entity Type** to `Products`.

1. Set **Import Behavior** to `Replace`.

   This option overwrites the previous data for your bundle product, rather than adding your changes as additional items.

1. Scroll down to the _File to Import_ section and click <span class="btn">Choose File</span>.

1. Select the CSV file that you edited.

1. Click <span class="btn">Check Data</span> and wait a few moments for the data to be checked.

1. If the file is valid, click <span class="btn">Import</span>.

1. When the process is complete, go to **System** > _Tools_ > **Cache Management** and click <span class="btn">Flush Cache Storage</span>.

   This ensures that the updated product is immediately available in the storefront.
