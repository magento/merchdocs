For the security of your business, user accounts are locked by default after six failed attempts to [log in]({% link stores/admin-signin.md %}) to the Admin. Any user account that is currently locked appears in the Locked Users grid. An account can be unlocked by any other user with full Administrator permissions.

Additional password security measures can be implemented in the [Advanced Admin]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %}) configuration. See [Admin Security]({% link stores/security-admin.md %}).
