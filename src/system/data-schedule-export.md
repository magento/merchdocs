title: Scheduling an Export
---

Scheduled Export is similar to manual [Export]({% link system/data-export.md %}), with respect to the available export file format and types of entities that can be exported:

- You can export to CSV format
- You can export product and customer data

The advantage of using Scheduled Export is that you can export data multiple times automatically, after specifying the export parameters, and schedule only once.

_Add Scheduled Export_

The details of each export are not written to a log, but in case of failure you will receive an Export Failed email, which contains the error description. The result of the last export job appears in the Last Outcome column on the Scheduled Import/Export page.

After each export, the export file is placed in the user-defined location, and a copy of the file is placed in the `var/log/import_export`directory on the server where Magento is deployed. The timestamp and the marker of the exported entity (products or customers) and type of the operation (in this case, export) are added to the export file name.

## Step 1: Complete the Export Settings

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **System** > _Data Transfer_ > **Scheduled Import/Export**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add Scheduled Export</span> and do the following:

   - Enter a **Name** for the scheduled export.

   - Enter a brief **Description** that explains the purpose of the export, and how it is to be used.

   - Set **Entity Type** to one of the following: `Products` or `Customers`

        The _Entity Attributes_ section at the bottom of the page is updated to reflect the selected Entity Type.

   - Set **Start Time** to the hour, minute, and second that the export is scheduled to begin.

   - Set **Frequency** to one of the following:

      - `Daily`
      - `Weekly`
      - `Monthly`

1. To activate the scheduled export, set **Status** to `Enabled`.

1. Accept `CSV` as the default **File Format**.

## Step 2: Complete the Export File Information

1. Set **Server Type** to one of the following:

   - `Local Server` - To save the export file on the same server where Magento is installed.
   - `Remote FTP` — To save the export file on a remote server.

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    When the Remote storage module is enabled, the `Local Server` **Server Type** automatically switches to `Remote Storage`.

1. Enter the **File Directory** where the export file is to be saved as follows:

   - For **Local Server**, enter a relative path within the Magento installation, such as `var/export`. If the Remote storage module is configured, use `import_export/export`.
   - For **Remote FTP server**, enter the full URL and path to the target folder on the destination server.

## Step 3: Configure the Export Failed Emails

1. Set **Failed Email Receiver** to the store contact who is to receive notification if an error occurs during the export.

1. Set **Failed Email Sender** to the store contact that appears as the sender of the notification.

1. Set **Failed Email Template** to the template that is used for the notification.

1. For **Send Failed Email Copy To**, enter the email address of anyone who is to receive a copy of the notification.

   For multiple email addresses, separate with a comma.

1. Set **Failed Email Copy Method** to one of the following:

   - `Bcc` - Sends a blind courtesy copy. The name and address of the recipient is included in the original email distribution, but is hidden from view.
   - `Separate Email` — Sends the copy as a separate email.

    _Export Failed Emails_

## Step 4: Choose the Entity Attributes

1. In the _Entity Attributes_ section, choose the attributes that you want to include in the export data.

   - To filter export data by attributes value, enter the attribute value in the Filter column.
   - To exclude products or customers with certain attribute values, enter the values of the attributes that you want to exclude, and select the checkbox in the Skip column.

1. When complete, click **Save**.

    The new scheduled export job is added to the list on the _Scheduled Import/Export_ page. From this page it can be run immediately, for testing, and edited.
