The Import and Export tools give you the ability to manage multiple records in a single operation. You can not only import new items, but also update, replace, and delete existing sets of products. For example, you can add new products to your inventory, update product data and advanced price data, and replace a set of existing products with new products. If you have a large catalog of products, it is much easier to export the data, edit the data in a spreadsheet, and import it back into your store.
