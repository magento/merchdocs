title: Data Transfer

The Import and Export tools give you the ability to manage multiple records in a single operation. You can not only import new items, but also update, replace, and delete existing sets of products. For example, you can add new products to your inventory, update product data and advanced price data, and replace a set of existing products with new products. If you have a large catalog of products, it is much easier to export the data, edit the data in a spreadsheet, and import it back into your store.

In addition to the Import and Export tools, Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source have processes like [catalog sync]({% link system/catalog-sync.md %}) that export product data from the Commerce server to SaaS services so features like [Product Recommendations]({% link marketing/product-recommendations.md %}) can accurately return recommendations with correct names, pricing, and availability.
