title: System Upgrade

{% include web-setup-deprecate.md %}

The System Upgrade tool can be used to upgrade your Magento installation from the Admin. The upgrade is a three-step process that should take place during off-peak hours. Before upgrade takes place, your store is put into maintenance mode, checked for readiness, and backed up.

We strongly recommend reviewing the latest [release notes][1]{:target="_blank"} and [system requirements][2]{:target="_blank"} in the developer documentation.

## Upgrade requirements

- Only the primary account holder is authorized to download code from the repository.
- The authorization keys that are used to download code must be generated from the primary account.
- {:.ee-only}The merchant or developer must submit a ticket to Support and request authorization for the download.

## Caching and reindexing

Always flush the cache when upgrading from one version of Open Source or Commerce to another. Two upgrade examples include: upgrading from Magento Open Source 2.2.X to 2.3.X and upgrading from Magento Open Source 2.3.X to Magento Commerce 2.3.X.

For developer information on upgrades, see [Command Line Upgrade][3]{:target="_blank"} in the developer documentation. The upgrade instructions include scripts to help run and complete your upgrades. These steps require developer assistance.
