The _Product Listings_ page contains several tabs from which you can view the statuses of all of your listings as well as match your products to Amazon listings.

The listing tasks available differ slightly on each tab, but the [workspace controls]({% link sales-channels/asc/workspace-controls.md %}) are the same and allow you to customize the data that shows for your listings.

Under **Actions**, options can apply the action to multiple listings, while options under **Select** in the _Action_ column apply the action only to the individual listing.
