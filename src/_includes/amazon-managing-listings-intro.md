The Product Listings screen contains several tabs from which you can view the statuses of all of your listings as well as match your products to Amazon listings.

Each tab differs slightly in the tasks available in the **Actions** drop-down, the **Select** (Action column) drop-down, and the default and available table columns, but the [workspace controls]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales-channels/amazon/workspace-controls.md %}) are the same and allow you to customize the data that is displayed.

The **Actions** drop-down options can apply the selected action to all listings selected (checked), while options in the **Select** drop-down in the **Action** column apply the action only to the individual listing.
