If you want to review reservations, a series of command line options are available. You can only review reservations through a command line interface. Using CLI commands may require developer assistance. See DevDocs [Inventory CLI reference](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/inventory/inventory-cli-reference.html).
