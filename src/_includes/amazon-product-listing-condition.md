Amazon requires a product listing to have a defined condition. If all your products are new, you can select one of the Amazon condition options in the drop down list to represent all of your products as your global condition value. Standard Amazon conditions include:

- New
- Refurbished
- Used; Like New
- Used; Very Good
- Used; Good
- Used; Acceptable
- Collectible; Like New
- Collectible; Very Good
- Collectible; Good
- Collectible; Acceptable

However, if your catalog contains products in different conditions (New, Used, Refurbished, etc.), you must select the **Assign Condition Using Product Attribute** option. This setting allows you to map your Magento condition attribute and values to your Amazon listing's conditions.

During [Pre-Setup Tasks]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-pre-setup-tasks.md %}), it was recommended that you create a Magento product attribute for a product's condition. If you offer products in various conditions and you have not created a condition attribute, see [Onboarding: Create a product attribute in Magento]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-creating-magento-attributes.md %}). Once the condition attribute is created, you can assign a condition value to each of your products in your Magento catalog.
