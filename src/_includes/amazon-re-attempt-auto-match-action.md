If products are not automatically matching, revisit your [Catalog Search]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-catalog-search.md %}) options in your listing lettings. If listings don't automatically match after updating your Catalog Search options, you can match products manually in the Update Required Info action.
