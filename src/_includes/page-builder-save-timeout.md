When you are working in the Page Builder workspace, your content changes are not fully saved until you click the _Close Full Screen_ (![]({% link images/images-ee/icon-pb-reduce.png %})) icon in the upper-right corner of the workspace, and then click <span class="btn">Save</span> in the upper-right corner for the CMS page, product page, category page, block, or dynamic block.

If you are making significant changes to Page Builder content, we recommend that you increase the [Admin Session Lifetime]({% link stores/security-admin.md %}) to prevent the session from timing out while you work.
