Catalog Search settings enable you to set matching search parameters that help to map eligible Magento products with Amazon listings. Once mapped, Amazon activates actions related to pricing, quantity, overrides, and order and product synchronization.

Defining these values increases the potential for exact matches, minimizing the need for manually matching product listings later. Adding the attributes as part of your onboarding [Pre-Setup Tasks]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-pre-setup-tasks.md %}), Amazon Sales Channel has a higher potential for automatically matching your products during onboarding and syncs product data between Amazon and Magento after onboarding.

If you only create the Amazon ASIN attribute (without adding ASINÂ values per product), your Magento products may not automatically your Amazon listings will automatically. You can manually match your products through Store Review. However, manual matching does not create the data elements needed to share and sync your product data.

**Important:** If you manually matched a product and you need to update an ASIN, UPC, or other data element for the product, you would have to update the data in both places, in your Magento catalog and in your Amazon listing in your Amazon Seller Central account.
