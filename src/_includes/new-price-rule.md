Price rules are automatically processed with other system rules. Processing frequency depends on your installation's [cron configuration](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cron.html). When you create a new price rule, allow enough time for it to get into the system. Then, test the rule to make sure that it works correctly.
