## To configure Product Listing Actions settings:

1. Expand the **Product Listing Actions** section.

1. For **Automatic List Action** (required), choose an option in drop-down:

    - **Automatically List Eligible Products**: Choose when you want your Magento catalog products (that meet Amazon's eligibility requirements) to automatically push to Amazon and create new Amazon Listings.

    - **Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products**: Choose when you want to manually select your eligible Magento catalog products and create new Amazon Listings. When selected, catalog products that meet your listing criteria and contain all required information display on the Ready to List tab for manual publishing. The [Ready to List]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ready-to-list.md %}) tab only displays when this option is selected.

1. For **Default Handling Time** (required), enter a numerical amount of lead time days needed before shipment. The default value is 2 days.

This default handing time value is only effective for Amazon listings created through Amazon Sales Channel. Any Amazon listings that were created in your Amazon Seller Central account use the default handling time set for the listing in Amazon.
