The Stock/Quantity settings are used to sync the product quantity details from your Magento storefront to the quantity on your Amazon Seller Central account. This tool is very powerful and can be leveraged for additional advertising by displaying urgency to the buyer while keeping your inventory organized. For example, some merchants may have 150 items of a particular SKU in stock in their warehouse, and want to make sure that Amazon shoppers can purchase all of their inventory. Other merchants may wish to only list one item at a time to create a sense of scarcity to the end user. To do this, you would set the Maximum Listed Quantity to 1.

Quantity is a regional attribute, and based on the Amazon Marketplace option selected during [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}). When a change is made to a product's quantity, the change will affect all Amazon listings that share that Amazon Seller SKU in your Amazon stores that sell in the same region (as defined during the store's integration). This means that a change to a shared Amazon Seller SKU in the North America region will not affect your Amazon stores with a region set for a different regionÂ (as defined during the store's integration). Your first Amazon store that is set up (with the oldest creation date) controls priority in the quantity settings.
