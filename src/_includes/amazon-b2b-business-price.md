Amazon Business is a marketplace exclusively open for Amazon registered business accounts, and only available in the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 2019. If the marketplace allows B2B business pricing, it will be editable within your listing settings.

B2B Business Pricing allows merchants with business accounts to purchase from each other with the expected performance of the Amazon shopping experience. With B2B business pricing, businesses can offer tiered pricing based on the quantity purchased.

For your products to be listed on the Amazon Business (B2B) site, you must first enable business in your Amazon Seller Central account. For more information on the B2B feature, see [Amazon: B2B Central][1]{: target="_blank"}.
