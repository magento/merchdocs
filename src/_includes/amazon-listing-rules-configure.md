## To configure Listing Rules settings:

1. Click **Listing Rules**.

2. For **Website**, select an option.

   These options are dependent on the [websites]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link stores/websites-stores-views.md %}) you have set up in your Magento configuration. Select the website to represent which website to have eligible products listed on Amazon. Only one website can be selected, as each website requires a unique Amazon store created in Amazon Sales Channel.

1. Define your desired conditions for the eligibility of products to be listed on Amazon.

See [Example: Define a Condition]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-define-condition-example.md %}).
