## Live Search 1.3.1

- Compatible with {{site.data.var.ee}} (EE): 2.4.x
- Compatible with {{site.data.var.ece}} (ECE): 2.4.x
- Stability: Stable

- {:.fix} [Custom price attribute]({% link stores/attributes-input-types.md %}) no longer returns an error when configured as a [facet]({% link live-search/facets-add.md %}).
- {:.fix} Fixed issue that caused an error to occur when no [currency symbol]({% link stores/currency-symbols.md %}) (`data-currency-symbol`) is available.
- {:.fix} [Storefront popover]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/storefront-popover.html) now shows the [Special Price]({% link catalog/product-price-special.md %}) (minimum final price) when available.
- {:.bug} The Live Search GraphQL API currently returns out-of-stock products regardless of the Stock Options - [Display Out of Stock Products]({% link configuration/catalog/inventory.md %}) configuration. As a result, the storefront [popover]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/storefront-popover.html) always displays out-of-stock products. However, they appear in product listings according to the Display Out of Stock configuration setting, and are filtered as needed when the page is rendered. As a result, product listings might show no products, or have a mismatched item count.

## Live Search 1.1.0

- Compatible with {{site.data.var.ee}} (EE): 2.4.x
- Compatible with {{site.data.var.ece}} (ECE): 2.4.x
- Stability: Stable

- {:.bug}The Live Search service supports only the [base currency]({% link stores/currency-configuration.md %}) of the {{site.data.var.ee}} installation.
- {:.bug}When adding a facet, the _Product Attributes Feed_ does not update correctly when set to `Update on Save`. To avoid this problem, go to [Index Management]({% link system/index-management.md %}) and set _Product Attributes Feed_ to `Update by Schedule`.
- {:.bug}Live Search synonyms are defined per store view, but are currently stored per website and identified with a combination of `environmentId` + `storeViewCode`. As a result, all websites and store views within the {{site.data.var.ee}} installation share the same set of synonyms. The most recently created set of synonyms for the store view takes precedence.
- {:.bug}If a synonym term contains multiple words, each word is treated as a separate synonym. For example, if you define “time piece” as a synonym of “watch”, both “time” and “piece” are treated as synonyms of watch.
