One- and two-way synonyms expand the definition of a keyword. Some words are interchangeable with a keyword, while others represent a subset of a keyword.

## Two-way

Two-way synonyms have the same meaning and return the same search results. In the following example, the first word shown in bold is the keyword that is used in the catalog, followed by words that have the same meaning as the original keyword. You can create a simple pair of two-way synonyms, or a chain of multiple two-way synonyms for the same keyword.

**jacket** ![Two-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-two-way.png %}) coat

**pants** ![Two-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-two-way.png %}) slacks ![Two-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-two-way.png %}) trousers

## One-way

A one-way synonym is a subset of a keyword, but with a more specific meaning. For example, capris and shorts are pants, but not all pants are capris or shorts. A search for pants includes capris and shorts. However, a search for shorts will not return capris.

**sweatshirt** ![One-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-one-way.png %}) hoodie

**pants** ![One-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-one-way.png %}) capris ![Multiple one-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-multiple-one-way.png %}) calf-length-pants ![Multiple one-way selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-multiple-one-way.png %}) peddle pushers

## Best practices

Keep in mind the following best practices to get the most from Live Search synonyms.

- Be consistent with the way terminology is used in your catalog. Keep in mind that there might be regional differences in usage, and sometimes within an industry.

  For example, the singular term “pant” is often used in the fashion industry and sometimes in retail, although the plural form “pants” is more commonly used. (The word “pant” technically refers to the part of a garment that covers one leg, which is why you need a “pair of pants” to cover both legs.

- It is never necessary to define both singular and plural forms a word as a synonym. If you have a mixture of singular and plural terms in your catalog, Search will find the correct set of products.

  For example, if you use the word “pant” in the product name and a shopper searches for “pants”, the correct set of products is returned, and the singular word “pant” is offered as a suggestion.
