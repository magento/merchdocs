With a focus on speed, relevance, and ease of use, Live Search is a game changer for shoppers and merchants alike. Follow along for a quick tour of Live Search from the storefront.

### Quick search

Enhanced quick search combines elements of search and browse, and returns categories, suggestions, and a thumbnail image of the top search results.

### Search as you type

Live Search returns dynamic and responsive results as soon as the shopper starts typing.

### Synonyms

Synonyms expand the reach and sharpen the focus of queries by including words shoppers might use that differ from those in your catalog. Merchants can fine tune the synonym dictionary to keep shoppers on the path to purchase.

### Infinite scroll

When shoppers click View all items, there is no need to navigate through pages of search results because additional items appear naturally as they scroll down the page.

### Faceted search

The Filters list in the left sidebar lists the available values derived from the current set of returned products. Filtered search uses multiple dimensions of static and dynamic attribute values, or facets, as search criteria. The selection of filters changes according to the products returned.

Price buckets group products by price range and make it easy to shop by price. Unlike price navigation, each price range of each bucket overlaps the previous bucket by one dollar to smooth the transition between price buckets.

### Enhanced category browse

When a shopper browses by category from the main menu, a paginated results list is returned with layered navigation in the left sidebar. However, just below the paginated list is an additional list of filterable search results that operates independently of the first list. Shoppers can browse by category and conduct a different filtered search from the same page.

Individual child SKUs are supported for configurable products, which makes it possible to browse directly to a specific product variation by SKU rather than to the parent product.

### Merchandising rules

Shape the shopping experience with if-then statements that add logic and events to search. Boost or bury products for a promotion, season, or other period of time.
