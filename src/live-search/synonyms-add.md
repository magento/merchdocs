## Step 1: Add a synonym

1. In the Admin, go to **Marketing** > SEO & Search > **Live Search**.
1. For multiple stores, set **Scope** to the [store view]({% link configuration/scope.md %}) where the synonym settings apply.
1. Click the **Synonyms** tab.
1. Click <span class="btn">Add synonyms</span>.

## Step 2: Define the synonym by type

Follow the instructions for the [type of synonym]({% link live-search/synonyms-type.md %}) that you want to create.

   In this example, the keyword is “pants” and the one-way expansion terms “capris, calf-length pants, peddle-pushers” are each a subset of “pants”, but with a specific meaning.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

   The set of synonyms appears in the list with a one-way arrow pointing from the expansion terms to the keyword to indicate the terms are subsets of the keyword. A plus sign separates each expansion term.
