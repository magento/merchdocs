The Live Search module is installed from the command line of the server and connects to your Adobe Commerce installation as a service.

To establish the connection between Live Search and your installation, the Commerce license holder can either [share access]({% link magento/magento-account-share.md %}) to the API Portal tab of their Commerce account, or give the [API Key]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/marketplace/eqp/v1/access-keys.html) and its download file to a trusted developer or system integrator who will complete the configuration of Adobe services.

When the installation, synchronization, and configuration of [Commerce Services]({% link configuration/services/saas.md %}) are complete, Live Search appears on the _Marketing_ menu under _SEO & Search_ in the Commerce Admin.

For full instructions, see [Install Live Search]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/live-search/install.html) in the developer documentation.
