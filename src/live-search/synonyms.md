For Adobe Commerce installations with Live Search installed, Live Search Synonyms replaces the standard Adobe Commerce [Search Synonyms]({% link marketing/search-synonyms.md %}) functionality, although both appear in the _SEO & Search_ section of the Adobe Commerce Marketing menu. If you use Live Search synonyms, follow the instructions in this section instead.

Synonyms expand the search query to include words that shoppers might use that differ from those in your catalog. You don't want to lose a sale because someone is looking for a "sofa", while your product is listed as a "couch". You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words customers might use to find your products.
