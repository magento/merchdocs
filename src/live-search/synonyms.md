For Magento Commerce installations with Live Search installed, Live Search Synonyms replaces the standard Magento [Search Synonyms]({% link marketing/search-synonyms.md %}) functionality, although both appear in the _SEO & Search_ section of the Magento Marketing menu. If you are using Live Search synonyms, follow the Live Search instructions in this section instead.

Synonyms expand the search query to include words that shoppers might use that differ from those in your catalog. You don't want to lose a sale because someone is looking for a "sofa", while your product is listed as a "couch". You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words customers might use to find your products.
