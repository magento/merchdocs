Follow these instructions to update the properties of existing facets or change their presentation in the storefront.

## Edit facet

1. Find the facet that you want to edit.

1. If there are many facets in the list, set _Filter by_ to one of the following:

     - Pinned
     - Dynamic

     To learn more, go to [Facet Types]({% link live-search/facets-type.md %}).

     ![Filter facets]({% link live-search/assets/facets-filter-by-cropped.png %}){: .zoom}
     _Filter by_

1. To edit the facet properties, click **More** (...) options.

1. Click **Edit**

     ![Edit options]({% link live-search/assets/facet-edit-menu.png %}){: .zoom}
     _Edit menu_

1. To edit the facet label, click the value in the first column and edit the text as needed.

     ![Edit label]({% link live-search/assets/facet-edit-label.png %}){: .zoom}
     _Edit label_

1. To change the method that is used to sort facet values, click the value in the _Sort Type_ column and choose one of the following:

     - Alphabetical
     - Count

     ![Edit count]({% link live-search/assets/facets-edit-count.png %}){: .zoom}
     _Edit count_

1. In the **Max Value** column, set the maximum number (from 0 – 10) of facet filter values to show in the storefront.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

     Your changes won’t appear in the storefront until after they are published.

## Pin/unpin facet

The Pin changes color when clicked and moves the facet to either the _Pinned Facets_ or the _Dynamic Facets_ section.

1. To pin a facet to the top of the Filters list, find the facet in the _Dynamic Facets_ list and click the gray Pin (![Pin selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-pin-gray.png %})).

     The pin turns blue and the facet moves to the _Pinned Facets_ section.

1. To unpin a facet, find the facet in the _Pinned Facets_ list and click the blue pin (![Pin selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-pin-blue.png %})).

     The pin turns gray and the facet moves to the _Dynamic Facets_ section.

     ![Pinned and dynamic facets]({% link live-search/assets/facets-pinned-unpinned.png %}){: .zoom}
     _Pinned and unpinned facets_

## Move pinned facet

The order of pinned facets can be changed by moving the row to a different position. Pinned facets have a Move icon (![Move selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-move.png %})) at the beginning of the row. Unlike pinned facets, dynamic facets cannot be moved.

1. Find the facet in the _Pinned Facets_ section of the list.

1. Use the **Move** (![Move selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-move.png %})) icon to drag the row to a new position in the _Pinned Facets_ section.

     After the changes are published, the facets appear in the storefront _Filters_ list in the new order.

## Delete facet

1. Find the facet in the list and click **More** (...) options.

1. Click **Delete**.

1. When prompted to confirm, click <span class="btn">Delete facet</span>.

     The facet is removed from the storefront after the changes are published.

## Publish changes

1. To update the storefront with your changes, click <span class="btn">Publish changes</span>.

1. Wait about fifteen minutes for the updates to appear in your store.
