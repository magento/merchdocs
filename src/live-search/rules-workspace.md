- Search for rules
- View rule details
- Activate/deactivate rules
- Delete rules

## Set the scope

If your Adobe Commerce installation includes multiple store views, set **Scope** to the [store view]({% link configuration/scope.md %}) where your rules apply.

## Show/hide columns

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Show/hide** ![Column selector]({% link live-search/assets/btn-show-hide-columns.png %}) columns.

   The visible columns have a blue check mark in the options menu. The rule name is the only column that cannot be hidden.

## Filter rules by status

1. If your store has many rules, you can filter the rules by status to shorten the list. By default, the Rules list displays all rules.

   ![Rules - filter by status]({% link live-search/assets/rules-workspace-filter-status.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Filter rules by status_

1. To list only rules with a specific status setting, set **Status** to one of the following:

   - All
   - Active
   - Inactive
   - Scheduled

   ![Rules - filter by status]({% link live-search/assets/rules-workspace-filter-status-active.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Rules filtered by "Active" status_

## Search rules by name

Begin typing the name of the rule, or any word in the rule name.

Search finds the matching rule(s) as you type. The string of matching characters are highlighted in the name of each rule found.

![Rules - search by name]({% link live-search/assets/rules-workspace-search-name.png %}){: .zoom}

## View details

The details panel shows the rule name, status, conditions and events, start and end date, description, and date last edited. Rules can be enabled, edited, and deleted from the details panel.
