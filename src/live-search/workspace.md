## Set the scope

Initially the [scope]({% link stores/websites-stores-views.md %}) of all Live Search settings is set to `Default Store View`. If your Commerce installation includes multiple store views, set **Scope** to the [store view]({% link configuration/scope.md %}) where your facet settings apply.
