## One Column

![]({% link images/images/layout-1-col-th.png %})

The _1 Column_ [layout]({% link design/page-layout.md %}) can be used to create a dramatic home page with a large image or focal point. It is also a good choice for a landing page, or any other page that has a combination of text, images, and video.

## Two columns with left bar

The _2 Columns with Left Bar_ layout is often used for pages with navigation on the left, such as a catalog or search results pages with layered navigation. It is also an excellent choice for home pages that need additional navigation or blocks of supporting content on the left.

## Two columns with right bar

![]({% link images/images/layout-2-col-rt-bar-th.png %})

With a _2 Columns with Right Bar_ layout, the main content area is large enough for an eye-catching image or banner. This layout is also often used for Product pages with blocks of supporting content on the right.

![]({% link design/page-layout.md %})

## Three columns

![]({% link images/images/layout-3-col-th.png %})

The _3 Column_ layout has a center column that is wide enough for the main text of the page, with room on each side for additional navigation and blocks of supporting content.

## Empty

The _Empty_ layout can be used to define custom page layouts. To learn more, see the [Designerâ€™s Guide to Magento][1].
