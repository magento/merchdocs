## 1 Column

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/layout-1-col-th.png %})

The “[1 Column]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link design/page-layout.md %})” layout can be used to create a dramatic home page with a large image or focal point. It’s also a good choice for a landing page, or any other page that has a combination of text, images, and video.

## 2 Columns with Left Bar

The “[2 Columns with Left Bar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link design/page-layout.md %})” layout is often used for pages with navigation on the left, such as a catalog or search results pages with layered navigation. It is also an excellent choice for home pages that need additional navigation or blocks of supporting content on the left.

## 2 Columns with Right Bar

With a “[2 Columns with Right Bar]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link design/page-layout.md %})” layout, the main content area is large enough for an eye-catching image or banner. This layout is also often used for Product pages with blocks of supporting content on the right.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link design/page-layout.md %})

## 3 Columns

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/layout-3-col-th.png %})

The “[3 Column]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link design/page-layout.md %})” layout has a center column that is wide enough for the main text of the page, with room on each side for additional navigation and blocks of supporting content.

## Empty

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/layout-blank-th.png %})

The “[Empty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link design/page-layout.md %})” layout can be used to define custom page layouts. To learn more, see the [Magento Designer’s Guide][1].
