title: Adding a Favicon

_Favicon_ is short for _favorite icon_ and refers to the little icon on the tab of each browser page. Depending on the browser, the favicon also appears in address bar, just before the URL.

A favicon is generally 16 x 16 pixels or 32 x 32 pixels in size. Magento accepts ICO, PNG, APNG, GIF, and JPG (JPEG) file types, although not all browsers support these formats. The most widely-supported file format to use for a favicon is ICO. You can use other image file types, but the format might not be supported by all browsers. There are many free tools available online that you can use to generate an ICO image or convert an image to that format.

## Step 1: Create a favicon

1. Using the image editor of your choice, create a 16 x 16 or 32 x 32 graphic image of your logo.

1. If you want to remove the current favicon, click the _Delete_ (![]({% link images/images/btn-delete.png %})) icon in the lower-left corner of the image.

1. Click <span class="btn">Upload</span> and open the favicon file that you prepared.

|File format|Description|
|--- |--- |
|ICO|This is an image file format designed for small size computer icon images. Mostly used in Microsoft Windows OS, the ICO format can contain images of up to 256 x 256 pixels and 16 million colors (24 bit) with 8 bits of transparency.|
|PNG|(Portable Network Graphics) This newer alternative to the GIF format supports up to 16 million colors (24 bit). The lossless compression format produces a high-quality bitmap image with crisp text, but a larger file size than some formats. The PNG format supports transparent layers, and is designed to be both viewed and streamed online.|
|APNG|(Animated Portable Network Graphics) A file format similar to PNG that supports simple animation.|
|GIF|(Graphics Interchange Format) A widely-supported, and older bitmap format that is limited to 256 colors (8 bit). The GIF format supports simple animation and transparent layers.|
|JPG (JPEG)|(Joint Photographics Expert Group) A compressed bitmap format that is used by most digital cameras. The lossy compression causes some data loss, which is sometimes noticeable as blurry spots in text.|
