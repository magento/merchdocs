One of the first things you will want to do is to [change the logo]({% link design/logo-upload.md %}) in the header and [upload a favicon]({% link design/favicon.md %}) for the browser. You will also want to [add your welcome message]({% link design/welcome-message.md %}) and [update the copyright notice]({% link design/copyright-notice.md %}) in the footer. These are a few simple design tasks that you can take care of right away. While your store is in development, you can [turn on the store demo notice]({% link design/demo-notice.md %}), and then remove it when you are ready to launch.
