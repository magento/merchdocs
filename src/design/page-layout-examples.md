The column dimensions are determined by style sheet of the theme. Some themes apply a fixed pixel width to the page layout, while others use percentages to make the page respond to the width of the window or device.

Most desktop themes have a fixed width for the main column, and all activity takes place within this enclosed area. Depending on your screen resolution, there is empty space on each side of the main column.

## 1 Column Layout

The content area of a “1 Column” layout spans the full-width of the main column. This layout is often used for a home page with a large banner or slider, or pages that require no navigation, such as a login page, splash page, video, or full-page advertisement.
