The size and location of the logo in the header is determined by the store theme. Your logo can be saved as either a GIF, PNG, or JPG (JPEG) file type and uploaded from the Admin of your store.

_Logo in Header_

The logo image resides in the following location on the server. Any image file with the name `logo.gif` is used as the default theme logo.

| Full path | `app/design/frontend/[vendor]/[theme]/web/images/logo.gif` |
| Relative path | `images/logo.gif` |

If you do not know the size of the logo or other images used in your theme, open the page in a browser, right-click the image, and inspect the element.

In addition to the logo in the header, your logo also appears on [email templates]({% link marketing/email-logo.md %}) and on [PDF invoices]({% link marketing/sales-document-pdf-logo.md %}) and other sales documents. The logos used for email templates and invoices have different size requirements, and must be uploaded separately. To learn more, see [Communications]({% link marketing/communications.md %}).

## Logo file formats

|File format|Description|
|--- |--- |
|PNG|(Portable Network Graphics) This newer alternative to the GIF format supports up to 16 million colors (24 bit). The lossless compression format produces a high-quality bitmap image with crisp text, but a larger file size than some formats. The PNG format supports transparent layers, and is designed to be both viewed and streamed online.|
|GIF|(Graphics Interchange Format) A widely supported, and older bitmap format that is limited to 256 colors (8 bit). The GIF format supports simple animation and transparent layers.|
|JPG (JPEG)|(Joint Photographics Expert Group) A compressed bitmap format that is used by most digital cameras. The lossy compression causes some data loss, which is sometimes noticeable as blurry spots in text.|
