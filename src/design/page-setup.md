The main sections of the page are controlled, in part, by a set of standard HTML tags. Some of these tags can be used determine the selection of fonts, color, size, background colors, and images that are used in each section of the page. Other settings control page elements such as the logo in the header, and the copyright notice in the footer. These sections correspond to the underlying structure of the HTML page, and many of the basic properties can be set from the Admin.

- [HTML Head]({% link design/html-head.md %})
- [Header]({% link design/header.md %})
- [Footer]({% link design/footer.md %})
