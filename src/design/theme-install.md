title: Installing a New Theme
---

When you first install Magento, the design elements of the store are based on the “Default” theme. The Luma theme is also available if you installed the sample data. You can modify a theme, add themes created by others, or create new ones. [Magento Marketplace]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link magento/magento-marketplace.md %}) contains a growing selection of themes that you can install to change the appearance of your store. To learn how to create or modify a theme, see the [Frontend Developer Guide][1].
