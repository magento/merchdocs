When you first install Commerce the design elements of the store are based on the default _Magento Blank_ theme. The _Luma_ theme is also available if you installed the sample data. You can modify a theme, add themes created by others, or create new ones. [Commerce Marketplace]({% link magento/magento-marketplace.md %}) contains a growing selection of themes that you can install to change the appearance of your store. To learn how to create or modify a theme, see our [Frontend Developer Guide][1].
