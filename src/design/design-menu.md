title: Design Menu
---

Magento provides a variety of easy-to-use design options that you can use to make simple changes to your store. In addition, you will find many professionally designed themes available on Magento Connect. Like the window dressing of your store, you can change the theme for the season or for a promotion.

More advanced users appreciate the flexibility of working with an object-oriented environment that assembles pages from separate components. After you understand the basics, youâ€™ll appreciate working in such a flexible and fluid environment. To learn more, see the [Frontend Developer Guide][1].
