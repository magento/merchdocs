title: HTML Head
---

The settings in the HTML Head section correspond to the `<head>` tag of an HTML page, and can be configured for each store view. In addition to meta data for the page title, description, and keywords, the section includes a link to the favicon, and miscellaneous scripts. Instructions for search engine robots and the display of the store demo notice are also configured in this section.

## Configure the HTML Head

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Design_ > **Configuration**.

1. Find the store view that you want to configure and click **Edit** in the _Action_ column.

1. Under _Other Settings_, expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **HTML Head** section.

   ![]({% link images/images/design-configuration-html-head.png %}){: .zoom}

1. Update the [favicon]({% link design/favicon.md %}) if needed.

1. Update the page title settings according to your needs:

   - **Default Page Title**
   - **Page Title Prefix**
   - **Page Title Suffix**

   You can use a suffix and/or prefix with the default title to create a two-or three part title. You can add a vertical bar or colon as a separator between the prefix or suffix and the default title.

1. Add or modify meta data to support Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and help steer customers to your store from search results:

   - **Default Meta Description**
   - **Default Meta Keywords**

1. Enter any **Scripts and Style Sheets** as needed.

1. Enable or disable the [demo store notice]({% link design/demo-notice.md %}) if needed.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Configuration</span>.
