## Edit the design configuration

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Design_ > **Configuration**.

1. Find the store view that you want to configure. Then, click **Edit** in the _Action_ column.

    The page displays the current design settings for the store view.

1. To change the Default Theme, set **Applied Theme** to the theme that you want to apply to the view.

    If no theme is specified, the system default theme is used. Some third-party extensions modify the system default theme.

1. If the theme is to be used for only a specific device, do the following:

    - Under **Design Rule** section under **User Agent Rules**, click <span class="btn">Add New User Agent Rule</span>.

    - In the **Search String** column, enter the browser ID for the specific device.

    - A search string can be either a normal expression or Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE). To learn more, see: [User Agent][1]{:target="_blank"}. The following search string identifies Firefox:

            /^mozilla/i

    - In the <b>Theme Name </b>column, choose the theme that is to be used for the specified device.

        _User-Agent Rules_

    - Repeat the process to enter additional devices. Search strings are matched in the order they are entered.

1. Under **Other Settings**, expand each section. Then, follow the instructions in the linked topics to edit the settings as needed.
