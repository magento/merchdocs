The Design Configuration makes it easy to edit design-related rules and configuration settings by displaying the settings on a single page.

_Design Configuration page_

## Change the design configuration

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Design_ > **Configuration**.

1. Find the store view that you want to configure and click **Edit** in the _Action_ column.

   The page displays the current design settings for the store view.

1. To change the default theme, set **Applied Theme** to the theme that you want to apply to the view.

   If no theme is specified, the system default theme is used. Some third-party extensions modify the system default theme.

1. If the theme is to be used for only a specific device, set the **User Agent Rules**.

   _User-Agent Rules_

   For each device type where you want to specify a theme:

   - Click <span class="btn">Add New User Agent Rule</span>.

   - For **Search String**, enter the browser ID for the specific device.

      A search string can be either a normal expression or Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE). To learn more, see [User Agent][1]. The following search string identifies Firefox:

            /^mozilla/i

   - For **Theme Name**, choose the theme to be used for the specified device.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   You can add as many rules for the devices you want to designate. The search strings are matched in the order they are entered.

1. Under _Other Settings_, expand each section and follow the instructions in the linked topics to edit the settings as needed.
