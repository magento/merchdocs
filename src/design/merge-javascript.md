title: Merging JavaScript Files
---

Multiple JavaScript files can be merged into a single, condensed file to reduce page load time. If you open a merged JavaScriptÂ file, you will find one continuous stream of text, with line breaks removed. If you are finished with the development process and the code contains no errors, you might consider merging the files.
