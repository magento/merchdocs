The term static files refers to the collection of assets, such as CSS, fonts, images, and JavaScript, that is used by a theme. The location of static files is specified in the [Base URL]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}) configuration.

A digital signature can be added to the URL of each static file to make it possible for browsers to detect when a newer version is available. The newer version of the file is used if the signature differs from what is stored in the browser's cache.

For a standard installation, the assets associated with a theme are organized in the `web` folder at the following location below the Magento root.

   `[magento_root]/app/design/frontend/Magento/[theme_name]/web`
