Your store receives messages from Magento on a regular basis. The messages are rated by importance and might refer to system updates, patches, new releases, scheduled maintenance, or upcoming events. The bell icon in the header indicates the number of unread messages in your inbox.

_Incoming Messages_

Any message of critical importance appears in a pop-up window when you log into your store. The notice continues to appear after each login until the message is either marked as read or removed.

_Message of Critical Importance_

The Notifications page lists all messages ranked by severity, with the most recent at the top. The Action commands can be used to mark individual messages as read, view more detailed information, or to remove the message from the inbox.

The configuration determines how often the inbox is updated, and how the messages are delivered. If your store Admin has a secure URL, notifications must be delivered over HTTPS.
