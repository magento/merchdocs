The Commerce _Admin_ is protected by multiple layers of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your store, order, and customer data. The first time you sign in to the _Admin_, you are required to enter your username and password and to set up [two-factor authentication]({% link stores/security-two-factor-authentication.md %}) (2FA).

Depending on the configuration of your store, you might also be required to resolve a [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-google-recaptcha.md %}) challenge such as entering a series of keyboard characters, solving a puzzle, or clicking a series of images with a common theme. These tests are designed to identify you has human, rather than an automated bot.

For additional security, you can determine which parts of the _Admin_ each user has [permission]({% link system/permissions.md %}) to access, and also limit the number of [login attempts]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %}). By default, after six attempts the account is locked, and the user must wait a few minutes before trying again. [Locked accounts]({% link system/permissions-locked-users.md %}) can also be reset from the _Admin_.

The first time you sign in to the _Admin_, you are given the opportunity to _Allow admin usage data collection_. See [Store Admin]({% link stores/admin.md %}) for more information.

_Admin sign in_

## Step 1: Set up two-factor authentication

Before you can sign in to the _Admin_ of your store, you must have a two-factor authentication solution set up and ready to use. To learn more about the authentication process used by each solution, see [Using Two-Factor Authentication]({% link stores/security-two-factor-authentication-use.md %}). By default, Commerce supports [Google Authenticator][1].

Ask your Commerce system administrator which 2FA solutions are supported for the store. Then, complete the setup of your preferred 2FA solution according to the provider's instructions.

## Step 2: Sign in to the Admin

1. Enter the _Admin_ URL that was specified during the Commerce installation.

   The default _Admin_ URL looks something like `https://www.yourdomain.com/your-custom-admin-domain`.

   {: .bs-callout-info}
   Although we use `admin` as the base URL in most examples, we recommend that you choose a unique and hard-to-guess [custom URL]({% link stores/store-urls-custom-admin.md %}) for the _Admin_ of your store.

   You can bookmark the page or save a shortcut on your desktop for easy access.

1. Enter your _Admin_ **Username** and **Password**.

1. (Optional) If a CAPTCHA is enabled for your store, follow the onscreen instructions to resolve the challenge. To learn more, see [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-captcha.md %}) and [reCAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-google-recaptcha.md %}).

1. Click **Sign in**.

   If this is the first time you have signed in to the _Admin_ from this account, you will receive an email with a link to configuration instructions.

## Step 3: Complete the 2FA configuration

The following example shows how to pair your _Admin_ account with Google Authenticator.

1. When the QR code appears, use one of the following methods to capture the code and pair Google Authenticator with your _Admin_ account.

   ![]({% link stores/assets/admin-login-google-auth-setup.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Set up Google Authenticator_

   - Capture QR Code using a smart phone

      On your smart phone, launch Google Authenticator. Tap the **plus** sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the app. Then at the bottom of the screen, tap **Scan Barcode** and take a picture of the QR code.

   - Capture QR Code from browser

      If Google Authenticator is installed as an extension in your browser, click the **Authenticator** icon in the toolbar and capture the page.

   - Manually enter QR code

      Copy the string of text below the QR code. Launch Google Authenticator with either your smart phone or browser, and click the plus sign (+). Then, choose **Manual Entry**. Under **Account**, enter the email address that is associated with your _Admin_ account and paste the QR code string into the **Key** field.

1. To sign in to the _Admin_ with two-factor authentication, enter the six-digit code generated by Google Authenticator into the **Authenicator code** field, and then click <span class="btn">Confirm</span>.

   _Enter the Authenticator code_

## Reset your password

Reuse of the last four passwords assigned to the account is not allowed.

1. Enter the **Email Address** that is associated with the _Admin_ account.

   ![]({% link stores/assets/admin-sign-in-forgot-password.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Forgot Password_

1. Click <span class="btn">Retrieve Password</span>.

   If an account is associated with the email address, an email will be sent to reset your password.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   An _Admin_ password must be seven or more characters long and include both letters and numbers. See [Configuring _Admin_ Security]({% link stores/security-admin.md %}) for information about password options.

## Sign out of the Admin

1. In the upper-right corner, click the **Account** (![Account]({% link assets/icon-admin-user.png %})) icon.

1. Click **Sign Out**.

![]({% link stores/assets/admin-sign-out.png %}){: .zoom}
_Sign Out_

The Sign In page displays a message that you are logged out. We recommend you sign out of the _Admin_ any time you leave your computer unattended.

## Allow multiple Admin logins

The Admin provides access to manage the orders, customers, products, shipping, and payments functionality. The default configuration is set to disallow multiple logins for an Admin user account as a security best practice. However, you can change this setting to allow Admin users to be logged in from multiple devices if that is needed to accommodate your business workflows.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

    ![]({% link stores/assets/multiple-admin-login.png %}){: .zoom}

1. In the left panel, expand **Advanced** and choose **Admin**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the **Security** section.
