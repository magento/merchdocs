The Magento Admin is protected by multiple layers of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your store, order, and customer data. The first time you sign in to the _Admin_, you are required to enter your username and password and to set up [two-factor authentication]({% link stores/security-two-factor-authentication.md %}) (2FA).

Depending on the configuration of your store, you might also be required to resolve a [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-google-recaptcha.md %}) challenge such as entering a series of keyboard characters, solving a puzzle, or clicking a series of images with a common theme. These tests are designed to identify you has human, rather than an automated bot.

For additional security, you can determine which parts of the _Admin_ each user has [permission]({% link system/permissions.md %}) to access, and also limit the number of [login attempts]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %}). By default, after six attempts the account is locked, and the user must wait a few minutes before trying again. [Locked accounts]({% link system/permissions-locked-users.md %}) can also be reset from the _Admin_.

The first time you sign in to the _Admin_, you are given the opportunity to _Allow admin usage data collection_. See [Store Admin]({% link stores/admin.md %}) for more information.

_Admin Sign In_

## Step 1: Set up two-factor authentication

Before you can sign in to the _Admin_ of your store, you must have a two-factor authentication solution set up and ready to use. To learn more about the authentication process used by each solution, see [Using Two-Factor Authentication]({% link stores/security-two-factor-authentication-use.md %}). By default, Magento supports [Google Authenticator][1].

Ask your Magento system administrator which 2FA solutions are supported for the store. Then, complete the setup of your preferred 2FA solution according to the provider's instructions.

## Step 2: Sign in to the Admin

1. Enter the _Admin_ URL that was specified during the Magento installation.

   The default _Admin_ URL looks something like `https://www.yourdomain.com/your-custom-admin-domain`.

   {: .bs-callout-info}
   Although we use `admin` as the base URL in most examples, we recommend that you choose a unique and hard-to-guess [custom URL]({% link stores/store-urls-custom-admin.md %}) for the _Admin_ of your store.

   You can bookmark the page or save a shortcut on your desktop for easy access.

1. Enter your _Admin_ **Username** and **Password**.

1. (Optional) If a CAPTCHA is enabled for your store, follow the onscreen instructions to resolve the challenge. To learn more, see [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-captcha.md %}) and [reCAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-google-recaptcha.md %}).

1. Click **Sign in**.

   If this is the first time you have signed in to the _Admin_ from this account, you will receive an email with a link to configuration instructions.

## Step 3: Complete the 2FA configuration

The following example shows how to pair your _Admin_ account with Google Authenticator.

1. When the QR code appears, use one of the following methods to capture the code and pair Google Authenticator with your _Admin_ account.

   _Set Up Google Authenticator_

   - Capture QR Code using a smart phone

      On your smart phone, launch Google Authenticator. Tap the **plus** sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the app. Then at the bottom of the screen, tap **Scan Barcode** and take a picture of the QR code.

   - Capture QR Code from browser

      If Google Authenticator is installed as an extension in your browser, click the **Authenticator** icon in the toolbar and capture the page.

   - Manually enter QR code

      Copy the string of text below the QR code. Launch Google Authenticator with either your smart phone or browser, and click the plus sign (+). Then, choose **Manual Entry**. Under **Account**, enter the email address that is associated with your _Admin_ account and paste the QR code string into the **Key** field.

1. To sign in to the _Admin_ with two-factor authentication, enter the six-digit code generated by Google Authenticator into the **Authenicator code** field, and click <span class="btn">Confirm</span>.

   _Enter Authenticator Code_

## Reset your password

Magento does not allow the reuse of the last four passwords assigned to the account.

1. Enter the **Email Address** that is associated with the _Admin_ account.

   ![]({% link images/images/admin-sign-in-forgot-password.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Forgot Password_

1. Click <span class="btn">Retrieve Password</span>.

   If an account is associated with the email address, an email will be sent to reset your password.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   An _Admin_ password must be seven or more characters long and include both letters and numbers. See [Configuring _Admin_ Security]({% link stores/security-admin.md %}) for information about password options.

## Sign out of the Admin

1. In the upper-right corner, click the **Account** (![Account]({% link images/images/btn-account.png %})) icon.

1. Click **Sign Out**.

_Sign Out_

The Sign In page displays a message that you are logged out. We recommend you sign out of the _Admin_ any time you leave your computer unattended.
