Magento uses attributes to manage the information associated with products, customers, and product ratings. Attributes are pieces of information that might appear as fields in forms, reports, product reviews, [layered navigation]({% link catalog/navigation-layered.md %}), and email messages. Some attributes are built into the system, and others can be created to address specific needs.
