When viewed from the Admin, attributes are the fields that you complete when you create a product. The input type that is assigned to an attribute determines the type of data that can be entered and the format of the field or input control. From the standpoint of the customer, attributes provide information about the product, and are the options and data entry fields that must be completed to purchase a product.

|Property|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Text Field|A single line input field for text.|
|Text Area|A multiple-line input field for entering paragraphs of text, such as a product description. You can use the WYSIWYG Editor to format the text with HTML tags, or enter the tags directly into the text.|
|Text Editor|A fully-functioning text editor at the attribute location.|
|Date|Displays a date value in the [preferred format]({% link stores/attribute-date-time-options.md %}) and [time zone]({% link stores/locale-options.md %}). Date values can be selected from a list or a calendar ( ![Calendar icon]({% link assets/icon-calendar.png %}) ). <br/><br/>**_Note:_** Depending on your system configuration, _Admin_ users can enter dates directly into a field or select a date from the calendar or list. For information about specifying date and time values, see [Date and Time Custom Options]({% link stores/attribute-date-time-options.md %}).|
|Date and Time|Displays a date and time value in the [preferred format]({% link stores/attribute-date-time-options.md %}) and [time zone]({% link stores/locale-options.md %}). The date and time can be entered manually or selected from a calendar. Example format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM|
