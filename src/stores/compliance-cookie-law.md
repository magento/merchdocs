Cookies are small files that are saved to the computer of each visitor to your site, and used as temporary holding places for information. Information that is saved in cookies is used to personalize the shopping experience, link visitors to their shopping carts, measure traffic patterns, and improve the effectiveness of promotions. To keep pace with legislation in many countries regarding the use of cookies, Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source offer merchants a choice of methods to obtain customer consent.

If you modified the default [Google privacy settings]({% link stores/compliance-privacy-google.md %}) to comply with the [General Data Protection Regulation]({% link stores/compliance-gdpr.md %}), it is no longer necessary to obtain user consent for the use of Google Analytics cookies.

## Method 1: Implied Consent

Implied consent means that visitors to your store have a clear understanding that cookies are a necessary part of operations, and by using your site, have indirectly granted permission to use them. The key to gaining implied consent is to provide enough information for a visitor to make an informed decision. Many stores display a message at the top of all standard pages that provides a brief overview of how cookies are used, with a link to the storeâ€™s privacy policy. The privacy policy should describe the type of information that your store collects, and how it is used.

## Method 2: Expressed Consent

Operating your store in [cookie restriction mode]({% link stores/compliance-cookie-restriction-mode.md %}) requires visitors to express their consent before any cookies can be saved to their computers. Unless consent is granted, many features of your store will be unavailable. For example, if Google Analytics is available for your store, it can be invoked only after the visitor has granted permission to use cookies.
