Customer attributes provide the information that is required to support the order, fulfillment, and customer management processes. Because your business is unique, you might need fields in addition to those provided by the system. You can add custom attributes to the Account Information, Address Book, and Billing Information sections of the customer’s account. Customer [address attributes]({% link stores/attributes-customer-address.md %}) can also be used in the Billing Information section during checkout, or when guests register for an account.

    _Customer Attribute Properties_

1. In the **Attribute Properties** section, do the following:

    - Enter a **Default Label** to identify the attribute during data entry.

    - Enter an **Attribute Code** to identify the attribute within the system.

    The attribute code must begin with a letter, and can include any combination of lowercase letters (a-z) and numbers (0-9). The code must be less than thirty characters in length, and cannot include special characters or spaces. The underscore character (`_`) can be used to indicate a space.

      **Shortcut:** To complete only the required fields at this time, scroll down to Storefront Properties, enter the Sort Order, and save.

1. Complete the **Data Entry Properties**.

    - To determine the type of input control that is used for data entry, set **Input Type** to one of the following:

      |Text Field|A single-line text field.|
      |Text Area|A multi-line text area.|
      |Multiple Line|Creates multiple text lines for the attribute, similar to a multi-line street address. The number of separate data entry lines can be from 2 to 20. Use the `Default Value` to specify the initial value of the field.|
      |Date|Displays a date field with a pop-up calendar. Additional properties: <br/>Use `Default Value` to specify the initial value of the field. <br/>Use `Minimal Value` to specify the earliest date that can be entered.  <br/>Use `Maximum Value` to specify the latest date that can be entered.|
      |Dropdown|A drop-down list that accepts only one value to be selected.|
      |Multiple Select|A drop-down list that accepts multiple values to be selected.|
      |Yes/No|A  field that offers only a choice of `Yes` or `No` values.|
      |File (attachment)|A field that allows a file to be uploaded and associated with the customer attribute as an attachment.|
      |Image File|A field that allows an image to be uploaded to the gallery and associated with the customer attribute.|

    - If the customer must enter a value in the field, set **Values Required** to `Yes`.

    - To assign an initial value to the field, enter a **Default Value**.

    - To check the data entered into the field for accuracy before the record is saved, set **Input Validation** to the type of data to be allowed in the field. The available values depend on the Input Type specified.

      | None | The field has no input validation during data entry. |
      | Alphanumeric | Accepts any combination of numbers (0-9) and alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z) during data entry. To include special characters, see [Escape HTML Entities](#escape-HTML). |
      | Alphanumeric with Space | Accepts any combination of numbers (0-9), alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z), and spaces during data entry. |
      | Numeric Only | Accepts only numbers (0-9) during data entry. |
      | Alpha Only | Accepts only alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z) during data entry. |
      | URL | Accepts only a URL during data entry. |
      | Email | Accepts only an email address during data entry. |
      | Length Only | Validates the input based on the length of the data entered into the field. |

    - To limit the size of Text Field and Text Area input types, enter the **Minimum Text Length** and **Maximum Text Length**.

    - To apply a preprocessing filter to values entered in a text field, text area, or multiple line input type, set **Input/Output Filter** to one of the following:

      | None | Does not apply a filter to text entered into the field. |
      | Strip HTML Tags | Removes HTML tags from the text. This filter can help clean up data that is pasted into a field from another source that includes HTML tags. |
      | Escape  HTML Entities | Converts special characters found in the text to a valid HTML escape sequence, such as `&amp;`. Escape sequences are enclosed between an ampersand and a semi-colon, and are frequently used for typographer’s smart quotes, copyright and trademark symbols. Escape sequences are also used to identify characters such as the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols, and the ampersand character which are also used in the code. This filter can help clean up special characters that are sometimes pasted into database fields from word processors. |
