Google reCAPTCHA ensures that a human being, rather than a computer (or "bot"), is interacting with your website. Unlike the standard Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source[CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-captcha.md %}), Google reCAPTCHA provides enhanced security with a selection of different display options and methods. Additional website traffic information is available in  the dashboard of your Google reCAPTCHA account.

Google reCAPTCHA is configured separately for the Admin and storefront.

- For the Admin, Google reCAPTCHA can be used on the [Sign In]({% link stores/admin-signin.md %}) page and when a user requests a password reset. If the standard Commerce [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-captcha.md %}) is also enabled, Google reCAPTCHA can be used at the same time without any problem.

- For the storefront, Google reCAPTCHA can be used to sign in to a [customer account]({% link customers/customer-sign-in.md %}), send a message from the [Contact Us]({% link stores/contact-us.md %}) page, and in numerous other storefront locations.

[Google reCAPTCHA][1] can be implemented in several ways:

- _reCAPTCHA v3 Invisible_ — Uses an algorithm to rate user interactions and determines the likelihood that the user is human based on a score.

- _reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible_ — Performs background verification without user interaction. Users and customers are automatically verified, but might be required to select specific images to complete a challenge.

- _reCAPTCHA v2 ("I am not a robot")_ — Validates requests with the _"I'm not a robot"_ checkbox.

Before Google reCAPTCHA can be configured, ensure that your `PHP.ini` file includes the following setting: `allow_url_fopen = 1`. This may require developer assistance. See [Required PHP Settings]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/guides/v{{ site.version }}/install-gde/prereq/php-settings.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Step 1: Generate Google reCAPTCHA keys

Google reCAPTCHA requires a pair of API keys to enable. You can get these keys free of charge through the [reCAPTCHA site][2]. Before generating the keys, you must know the type of reCAPTCHA that you want to use.

1. Open the [Google reCAPTCHA page][2] and log in to your account.

1. For **Label**, enter a name to identify the keys for internal reference.

   You need one set of keys for each reCAPTCHA type that is used in your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source installation. For example: `Commerce Invisible`

1. For **reCAPTCHA type**, choose the method that you want to use.

   - _reCAPTCHA v3 Invisible_
   - _reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible_
   - _reCAPTCHA v2 ("I am not a robot")_

1. For **Domain**, enter your store's domain. For example: mystore.com

   If you have multiple stores with different domains, enter each domain on a separate line.

   - Add your store domain and any subdomains.
   - You can add `localhost`, other local VM domains, and staging domains as needed for testing.

1. Select the checkbox to **Accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service**.

1. (Optional) Select the **Send alerts to owners** checkbox to send notification if Google detects issues or suspicious traffic.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   **Important!** Not all keys are applicable for all types of reCAPTCHA, and misapplying them could lead to unexpected behavior. For example, Google reCAPTCHA keys generated for _reCAPTCHA v2 "I'm not a robot"_ will not work with _reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible_ and could block functionality where reCAPTCHA is enabled.
