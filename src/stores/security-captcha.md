title: CAPTCHA
---

A CAPTCHA is a visual device that ensures that a human being, rather than a computer (or "bot"), is interacting with the site. CAPTCHA is an acronym for _Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart_. It can be used for both Admin access and a variety of storefront actions initiated by registered customers. Magento supports the standard CAPTCHA that is described in this topic and [Google reCAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-google-recaptcha.md %}).

You can reload the CAPTCHA as many times as is necessary by clicking the Reload icon in the upper-right corner of the image. The CAPTCHA is fully configurable and can be set appear every time, or only after a number of failed login attempts.

## Admin CAPTCHA

For an extra level of security, you can add a CAPTCHA to the Admin Sign In and Forgot Password page. Magento Admin users can reload the displayed CAPTCHA by clicking the Reload ![]({% link images/images/btn-reload.png %}) icon in the upper-right corner of the image. The number of reloads is unlimited.

### Configure CAPTCHA for the Admin

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand _Advanced_ and choose **Admin**.

1. In the upper-right corner, set **Store View** to `Default`.

    If the [scope]({% link stores/websites-stores-views.md %}) of your Magento installation includes multiple websites, choose the website(s) where you want the CAPTCHA configuration to apply.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **CAPTCHA** section.

1. Set **Enable CAPTCHA in Admin** to `Yes`. Then complete the remaining options as follows:

    ![Magento Admin - CAPTCHA configuration]({% link images/images/config-advanced-admin-captcha.png %}){: .zoom}
    [_Admin CAPTCHA Configuration_]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %})

   - Enter the name of the **Font** to be used for CAPTCHA symbols (default: `LinLibertine`).

        To add your own font, the font file must reside in the same directory as your Magento installation and must be declared in the `config.xml` file of the Captcha module at `app/code/Magento/Captcha/etc`.

   - Select any of the following **Forms** where the CAPTCHA is to be used. To choose multiple forms, hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or Command key (Mac).

      - Admin Login
      - Admin Forgot Password

   - Set **Displaying Modes** to one of the following:

      - `Always` — CAPTCHA is always required to log in to the Admin.
      - `After number of attempts to login` — This option applies only to the Admin Login form. When selected, the Number of Unsuccessful Attempts to Login field appears. Enter the number of login attempts that you want to allow. A value of 0 (zero) is similar to setting Displaying Mode to `Always`.

      To track the number of unsuccessful login attempts, each attempt to log in under one email address and from one IP-address is counted. The maximum number of login attempts allowed from the same IP-address is 1,000. This limitation applies only when CAPTCHA is enabled.

   - In the **Number of Unsuccessful Attempts to Login** field, enter the number of times the administrator can try to log in before the CAPTCHA appears. If set to zero (`0`), CAPTCHA is always required.

   - In the **CAPTCHA Timeout (minutes)** field, enter the number of minutes before the CAPTCHA expires. When the CAPTCHA expires, the administrator must reload the page.

   - Enter the **Number of Symbols** to appear in the CAPTCHA. Up to eight (`8`) symbols can be used. For a variable number of symbols that changes with each CAPTCHA, enter a range (such as `5-8`).

   - In the **Symbols Used in CAPTCHA** field, enter the letters (a-z and A-Z) and numbers (0-9) that you want to appear randomly in the CAPTCHA. Symbols that are hard to distinguish from other symbols, such as `i`, `l`, or `1`, are not included in the default set of CAPTCHA symbols.

   - Set **Case Sensitive** to `Yes` if you want to require administrators to enter the characters in upper- or lowercase exactly as shown in the CAPTCHA.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

## Storefront CAPTCHA

Customers can be required to enter a CAPTCHA each time they log in to their accounts, or after several unsuccessful attempts to log in. In addition, numerous forms used throughout the storefront can be configured to require verification by CAPTCHA.
