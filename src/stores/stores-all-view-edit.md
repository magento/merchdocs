title: Editing a Store View
---

Because the view name appears in the language chooser, you might eventually want to change the name of the default view to something more descriptive. The _Name_ field is simply a label and can be easily changed.

If your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source installation has a multisite or multi-store setup, do not change the store Code field without verifying that the value is not referenced in the `index.php` file. If you do not have access to the server to examine the file, ask a developer for help.

Field | Original value | Updated value
----- | -------------- | -------------
Name  | Default Store View | English
Code  | default | english
