title: Product Attributes
---

Product attribute properties determine how an attribute can be used in the catalog, its appearance and behavior in the store, and the data included in data transfer operations. The properties and labels associated with each attribute determine how it can be used and its presentation in the store.

- **Properties** — The Properties section includes both basic and advanced attribute properties.
- **Labels** — The label identifies an attribute in the Admin and also in the storefront of each store view. If your store is available in multiple languages, you can enter a different translated label for each language.
- **Storefront Properties** — The Storefront Properties determine how an attribute can be used in your store, its appearance, and behavior. You can specify if attributes are available for search, layered navigation, product comparisons, price rules, and sorting. For text attributes, you can enable the WYSIWYG editor and determine if HTML tags can be used to format the values.

To learn how to use attributes while creating a product, see [Using Product Attributes]({% link catalog/product-attributes.md %}).
