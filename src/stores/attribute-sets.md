One of the first steps when creating a product is to choose the attribute set that is used as a template for the product record. The attribute set determines the fields that are available during data entry, and the values that appear to the customer.

The attributes are organized into groups that determine where they appear in the product record. Your store comes with an initial attribute set, called _default_, that includes a set of commonly-used attributes. If you would like to add only a small number of attributes, you can add them to this default attribute set. However, if you sell products that require specific types of information, such as cameras, it might be better to create a dedicated attribute set that includes the specific attributes that are needed to describe the product.

## Create an attribute set

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Attributes_ > **Attribute Set**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add New Set</span>.

    ![Attribute set - edit name]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/attribute-set-new.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Edit Set Name_

1. Enter a **Name** for the attribute set.

1. Set **Based On** to an existing attribute set to be used as a template.

1. Click **Save**.

   The next page displays the following:

   - The left column shows the name of the attribute set. The name is for internal reference, and can be changed as needed.
   - The center of the page lists the current selection of attribute groups.
   - The right column lists the selection of attributes that are currently not assigned to the attribute set.

1. To add a new attribute to the set, drag the attribute from the **Unassigned Attributes** list to the appropriate folder in the **Groups** column.

   {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
   System attributes are marked with a dot and cannot be removed from the Groups list. They can, however, be dragged to another Group in the attribute set.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

## Create a new attribute group

1. In the **Groups** column the attribute set, click <span class="btn">Add New</span>.

1. Enter a **Name** for the new group, and click <span class="btn">OK</span>.

1. Do either of the following:

   - Drag **Unassigned Attributes** to the new group.
   - Drag attributes from any other group to the new group.

   The new group becomes a section of attributes in any product that is based on the attribute set.
