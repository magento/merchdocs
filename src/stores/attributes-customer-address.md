title: Customer Address Attributes
---

The Customer Address Attribute determines the properties of street addresses that are entered into the [address book]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %}) from the customer’s account or during [checkout]({% link sales/checkout-process.md %}).

Custom address attributes can be set up if you need to provide additional information such as an optional email address, Skype account, alternate phone number, building, or county. The custom attribute can then be incorporated into the [address template]({% link stores/attributes-customer-address-templates.md %}) that is used to produce sales documents. The process to create a custom address attribute is almost the same as creating a [customer attribute]({% link stores/attributes-customer.md %}).

Customer address attributes are used in the following forms:

- [Customer Address Registration]({% link customers/account-create.md %})
- [Customer Account Address]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %})

   _Customer Attribute Properties_

1. In the **Attribute Properties** section, do the following:

   - Enter a **Default Label** to identify the attribute during data entry.

   - Enter an **Attribute Code** to identify the attribute within the system.

      The attribute code must begin with a letter, and can include any combination of lowercase letters (a-z) and numbers (0-9). The code must be less than thirty characters in length, and cannot include special characters or spaces. The underscore character (_) can be used to indicate a space.

      **Shortcut:** To complete only the required fields at this time, scroll down to Storefront Properties, enter the Sort Order, and save.

1. Complete the **Data Entry Properties**.

   - To determine the type of input control that is used for data entry, set **Input Type** to one of the following:

      |Text Field|A single-line text field.|
      |Text Area|A multi-line text area.|
      |Multiple Line|Creates multiple text lines for the attribute, similar to a multi-line street address. The number of separate data entry lines can be from 2 to 20. Use the `Default Value` to specify the initial value of the field.|
      |Date|Displays a date field with a pop-up calendar. Additional properties: <br/>Use `Default Value` to specify the initial value of the field. <br/>Use `Minimal Value` to specify the earliest date that can be entered.  <br/>Use `Maximum Value` to specify the latest date that can be entered.|
      |Dropdown|A drop-down list that accepts only one value to be selected.|
      |Multiple Select|A drop-down list that accepts multiple values to be selected.|
      |Yes/No|A  field that offers only a choice of `Yes` or `No` values.|
      |File (attachment)|A field that allows a file to be uploaded and associated with the customer attribute as an attachment.|
      |Image File|A field that allows an image to be uploaded to the gallery and associated with the customer attribute.|

   - If the customer must enter a value in the field, set **Values Required** to `Yes`.

   - To assign an initial value to the field, enter a **Default Value**.

   - To check the data entered into the field for accuracy before the record is saved, set **Input Validation** to the type of data to be allowed in the field. The available values depend on the Input Type specified.

      | None | The field has no input validation during data entry. |
      | Alphanumeric | Accepts any combination of numbers (0-9) and alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z) during data entry. To include special characters, see [Escape HTML Entities](#escape-HTML). |
      | Alphanumeric with Space | Accepts any combination of numbers (0-9), alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z), and spaces during data entry. |
      | Numeric Only | Accepts only numbers (0-9) during data entry. |
      | Alpha Only | Accepts only alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z) during data entry. |
      | URL | Accepts only a URL during data entry. |
      | Email | Accepts only an email address during data entry. |
      | Length Only | Validates the input based on the length of the data entered into the field. |

   - To apply a preprocessing filter to values entered in a text field, text area, or multiple line input type, set **Input/Output Filter** to one of the following:

      | None | Does not apply a filter to text entered into the field. |
      | Strip HTML Tags | Removes HTML tags from the text. This filter can help clean up data that is pasted into a field from another source that includes HTML tags. |
      | Escape  HTML Entities | Converts special characters found in the text to a valid HTML escape sequence, such as `&amp;`. Escape sequences are enclosed between an ampersand and a semi-colon, and are frequently used for typographer’s smart quotes, copyright and trademark symbols. Escape sequences are also used to identify characters such as the less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbols, and the ampersand character which are also used in the code. This filter can help clean up special characters that are sometimes pasted into database fields from word processors. |

1. Complete the **Customers Grid and Segment Properties**.

   - To be able to include the column in the Customers grid, set **Add to Column Options** to `Yes`.

   - To filter the Customers grid by this attribute, set **Use in Filter Options** to `Yes`.

   - To search the Customers grid by this attribute, set **Use in Search Options** to `Yes`.

   - To make this attribute available to [customer segments]({% link marketing/customer-segments.md %}), set **Use in Customer Segment** to `Yes`.

## Step 2: Complete the Storefront Properties

1. To make the attribute visible to customers, set **Show on Storefront** to `Yes`.

1. Enter a number in the **Sort Order** field to determine its order of appearance when listed with other attributes.

1. Set **Forms to Use** to each form that is to include the attribute. To choose multiple options, hold the Ctrl key down and click each form.

   - [Customer Address Registration]({% link customers/account-create.md %})
   - [Customer Account Address]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %})
