With so many recommendation types to choose from, which should you use on each page? If you are not sure where to begin, try the following:

{: .fields-table }
|Home page|`Recommended for you`|
|Product page|`Viewed this, viewed that`|
|Cart|`Bought this, bought that`|

You can track the [metrics]({% link recommendations/workspace.md %}) and adjust if needed. Remember that experimentation is key.

Some storefront pages restrict where you can place the recommendations. You can place the recommendations in one of the following page locations. Refer to the table below for more information.

- At the top of main content - Recommendations appear above the main content area just below the top navigation bar.
- At the bottom of main content (default) - Recommendations appear below the main content area and before any other content blocks on the page, such as _Related Products_.
