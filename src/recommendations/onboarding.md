### B2B support {#b2bsupport}

B2B storefronts often require complex logic that dictates product visibility and pricing for each shopper or customer group. Product Recommendations now [support]({% link recommendations/release-notes.md %}) this functionality by honoring [category permissions]({% link catalog/category-permissions.md %}), [shared catalogs]({% link catalog/catalog-shared.md %}), and [customer group-specific pricing]({% link catalog/pricing-advanced.md %}). For example, if you have hidden certain categories from your retail customer segment, then a shopper in that segment would not be shown recommendations for products in those categories. Also, when you define a shared catalog for specific customer groups and companies, those shoppers will see recommendations only for products they can access. All recommended products will reflect correct customer group-specific price based on each shopper's customer group.
