The Product Recommendations workspace displays a list of previously configured recommendations with metrics that help you track the success of each recommendation. The list can be configured to calculate metrics for the last day, week, or month. You can use the metrics to create actionable insights based on how frequently a recommendation unit is viewed or clicked, or to analyze how well your recommendations perform.

Initially the [scope]({% link stores/websites-stores-views.md %}) of all recommendation settings is set to `Default Store View`. If your Commerce installation includes multiple store views, set **Scope** to the [store view]({% link configuration/scope.md %}) where your recommendations apply.

   The calculated values in the metrics columns change to reflect the current date range.

## Show/hide columns

1. In the upper-left corner, click **Show/hide** ![Column selector]({% link recommendations/assets/icon-show-hide-columns.png %}) columns.
