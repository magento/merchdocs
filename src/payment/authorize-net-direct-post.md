title: Authorize.Net Direct Post - Deprecated
---

{:.bs-callout-warning}
**Deprecation Notice** <br/>
Due to the Payment Service Directive [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) and the continued evolution of many APIs, this payment integration is at risk of becoming outdated and no longer security compliant in the future. Additionally, Authorize.Net has deprecated the Authorize.Net Direct Post payment method. We are recommending that you disable it in your Magento configuration and transition to the Authorize.Net [Magento Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=authorize.net){:target="_blank"}.<br/><br/>
**This integration will be removed from the Magento 2.4.0 release and has been deprecated from versions of 2.3.**<br/><br/>
For details about making a secure transition from deprecated payment integrations, see our [DevBlog](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Deprecation-of-Magento-core-payment-integrations/ba-p/426445){:target="_blank"}.

Authorize.Net handles all steps in the transaction process, such as payment data collection, data submission, and response to the customer, while the customer remains in your store.

## Customer Workflow

1. **Customer chooses payment method**. During checkout, the customer chooses Authorize.Net Direct Post (Deprecated) as the payment method.

1. **Customer submits the order**. The customer enters the credit card information, reviews the order, and taps the Place Order button.

1. **Authorize.Net completes the transaction**. Authorize.Net validates the card information, and processes the transaction.

   - If successful, the customer is redirected to the order confirmation page.

   - If the transaction fails, an error message appears, and the customer can try a different card, or choose a different  payment method.

## Setting Up Authorize.Net Direct Post (Deprecated)

### Step 1: Enable Authorize.Net Direct Post (Deprecated)

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Stores**. Then under **Settings**, choose **Configuration**.

1. In the panel on the left under **Sales**, choose **Payment Methods**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} the **Authorize.Net Direct Post (Deprecated)** section. Then, do the following:

       | **Authorize Only** | Funds on the customer's card are authorized by Authorize.Net, and an order is created in your store’s Admin. You can later create an invoice and capture the funds.|
       | **Authorize and Capture** | Funds on the customer's card are authorized and captured by Authorize.Net, and an order and invoice are created in your store’s Admin.|

   - Enter a **Title** to identify the Authorize.Net Direct Post (Deprecated) payment method during checkout.
