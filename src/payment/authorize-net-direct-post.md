title: Authorize.Net Direct Post - Deprecated
---

{:.bs-callout-warning}
**Deprecation Notice** <br/>
Due to the Payment Service Directive [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) and the continued evolution of many APIs, this payment integration is at risk of becoming outdated and no longer security compliant in the future. Additionally, Authorize.Net has deprecated the Authorize.Net Direct Post payment method. We are recommending that you disable it in your Magento configuration and transition to the Authorize.Net [Magento Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=authorize.net){:target="_blank"}.<br/><br/>
**This integration is removed from the Magento 2.4.0 release and has been deprecated from current versions of 2.3.**<br/><br/>
For details about making a secure transition from deprecated payment integrations, see our [DevBlog](https://community.magento.com/t5/Magento-DevBlog/Deprecation-of-Magento-core-payment-integrations/ba-p/426445){:target="_blank"}.

Authorize.Net handles all steps in the transaction process, such as payment data collection, data submission, and response to the customer, while the customer remains in your store.

## Customer workflow

1. **Customer chooses payment method**. During checkout, the customer chooses Authorize.Net Direct Post as the payment method.

1. **Customer submits the order**. The customer enters the credit card information, reviews the order, and clicks/taps the _Place Order_ button.

1. **Authorize.Net completes the transaction**. Authorize.Net validates the card information, and processes the transaction.

   - If successful, the customer is redirected to the order confirmation page.

   - If the transaction fails, an error message appears, and the customer can try a different card or choose a different payment method.

## Authorize.Net account credentials

Sign up for a Authorize.Net online [merchant account][3]. You will need the account credentials to connect your account in the Magento Admin.
