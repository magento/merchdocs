{:.bs-callout-warning}
**Deprecation Notice** <br/>
Due to the Payment Service Directive [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) and the continued evolution of many APIs, this payment integration is at risk of becoming outdated and no longer security compliant. For this reason, it is now deprecated and we are recommending that you disable it in your Magento 2.3.x configuration and transition to the official Braintree payment extension from [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree). <br/><br/>
**This integration has been deprecated from current versions of 2.3.x. and replaced with a different Braintree integration in 2.4.0 and later.**<br/><br/>

Braintree offers a fully customizable checkout experience with fraud detection and PayPal integration. Braintree reduces the PCI compliance burden for merchants because the transaction takes place on the Braintree system.

## Braintree account credentials

Go to [Braintree Payments][1] and sign up for an account. You will need the account credentials to connect your account in the Magento Admin.

### Step 6: Define the dynamic descriptors

The descriptors are used to identify purchases on customer credit card statements. You can reduce the number of chargebacks by clearly identifying the company that is associated with each purchase. If Dynamic Descriptors are not enabled for your account, contact [Braintree support](mailto:support@getbraintree.com?subject=Support for Dynamic Descriptors).

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Dynamic Descriptors** section.

1. Enter the dynamic descriptor for the **Name**, **Phone**, and **URL** according to these guidelines:

    | Name| There are two parts to the Name descriptor, which are separated by an asterisk (*). For example:<br/>`company*myproduct`<br/><br/>The first part of the descriptor identifies the company or DBA, and the second part identifies the product. The length of the Company and Product parts of the descriptor can be allocated in the following ways, for a combined length of up to twenty-two characters.<br/><br/>**Characters in Name Descriptor**<br/><br/>Option 1: Company must be three characters, Product may be up to 18 characters<br/><br/>Option 2: Company must be seven characters, Product may be up to 14 characters<br/><br/>Option 3: Company must be 12 characters, Product may be up to nine characters |
    | Phone | The Phone descriptor must be ten to 14 characters in length, and can include only numbers, dashes, parentheses, and periods. For example:<br/> `9999999999`<br/> `(999) 999-9999`<br/> `999.999.9999`|
    | URL | The URL descriptor represents your domain name and can be up to thirteen characters long. For example: <br/>`company.com` |
