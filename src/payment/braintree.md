**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. Starting with Magento ver. 2.2.3, Braintree provides native support for 3D Secure 2.0.<br/>To meet PSD2 requirements for earlier versions of Magento, install and configure the official Braintree payment integration extension from [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree). Older Braintree implementations that run on JavaScript SDK v2 do not support 3D Secure 2.0.

Braintree offers a fully customizable checkout experience with fraud detection and PayPal integration. Braintree reduces the PCI compliance burden for merchants because the transaction takes place on the Braintree system.

## **Step 7:** Dynamic Descriptors

The following descriptors are used to identify purchases on customer credit card statements. You can reduce the number of chargebacks by clearly identifying the company that is associated with each purchase. If Dynamic Descriptors are not enabled for your account, contact [Braintree support](mailto:support@getbraintree.com?subject=Support for Dynamic Descriptors).

1. Enter the Dynamic Descriptor for the **Name**, **Phone**, and **URL** according to these guidelines:

    | **Name** | There are two parts to the Name descriptor, which are separated by an asterisk (*). For example:<br/>`company*myproduct`<br/><br/>The first part of the descriptor identifies the company or DBA, and the second part identifies the product. The length of the Company  and Product parts of the descriptor can be allocated in the following ways, for a combined length of up to twenty-two characters.<br/><br/>**Characters in Name Descriptor**<br/><br/>Option 1: Company must be 3 characters, Product may be up to 18 characters<br/><br/>Option 2: Company must be 7 characters, Product may be up to 14 characters<br/><br/>Option 3: Company must be 12 characters, Product may be up to 9 characters |
    | **Phone** | The Phone descriptor must be ten to fourteen characters in length, and can include only numbers, dashes, parentheses, and periods. For example:<br/> `9999999999`<br/> `(999) 999-9999`<br/> `999.999.9999`|
    | **URL** | The URL descriptor represents your domain name, and can be up to thirteen characters long. For example: <br/>`company.com` |
