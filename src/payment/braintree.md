Braintree offers a fully customizable checkout experience with fraud detection and PayPal integration. Braintree reduces the PCI compliance burden for merchants because the transaction takes place on the Braintree system.

If you are upgrading to 2.4.x from an earlier version of Magento with the Braintree extension from Magento Marketplace installed, see the [Magento 2.4 Migration Notes](#migration) at the end of this topic.

## Step 6: Complete the 3D verification settings

1. If you want to add a verification step for customers using credit cards that are enrolled in a verification program such as “Verified by VISA,” set **3D Secure Verification** to `Yes`.

   During the process, the transaction amount that is submitted for verification is checked against the amount that is sent for authorization.

## **Step 7:** Dynamic descriptors

The following descriptors are used to identify purchases on customer credit card statements. You can reduce the number of chargebacks by clearly identifying the company that is associated with each purchase. If Dynamic Descriptors are not enabled for your account, contact [Braintree support](mailto:support@getbraintree.com?subject=Support for Dynamic Descriptors).

1. Enter the Dynamic Descriptor for the **Name**, **Phone**, and **URL** according to these guidelines:

    | **Name** | There are two parts to the Name descriptor, which are separated by an asterisk (*). For example:<br/>`company*myproduct`<br/><br/>The first part of the descriptor identifies the company or DBA, and the second part identifies the product. The length of the Company  and Product parts of the descriptor can be allocated in the following ways, for a combined length of up to twenty-two characters.<br/><br/>**Characters in Name Descriptor**<br/><br/>Option 1: Company must be 3 characters, Product may be up to 18 characters<br/><br/>Option 2: Company must be 7 characters, Product may be up to 14 characters<br/><br/>Option 3: Company must be 12 characters, Product may be up to 9 characters|
    | **Phone** | The Phone descriptor must be ten to fourteen characters in length, and can include only numbers, dashes, parentheses, and periods. For example:<br/> `9999999999`<br/> `(999) 999-9999`<br/> `999.999.9999`|
    | **URL** | The URL descriptor represents your domain name, and can be up to thirteen characters long. For example: <br/>`company.com`|

1. When your Braintree configuration is complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

**<a name="migration">Magento 2.4 Migration Notes:</a>**<br />
Before the release of Magento 2.4.0, we recommended that merchants replace the core Magento Braintree integration with the official Braintree extension from [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree). Beginning with Magento 2.4.0, the Braintree extension is included in the release.<br/><br/>
If you are migrating to Magento 2.4.x from a pre-2.4.0 version that has the Marketplace Braintree extension installed, you must uninstall the Marketplace Braintree extension (`paypal/module-braintree` or `gene/module-braintree`) and update any code customizations to use the `PayPal_Braintree` namespace instead of `Magento_Braintree`. Configuration settings from the core Magento Braintree Payments bundled extension and the extension distributed on Magento Marketplace will persist and payments placed with those previous versions of the extension can still be captured, voided, or refunded as normal.<br />
