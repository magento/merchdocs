Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon work together to create a great buyer experience. For more information, see the [Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon extension for Magento 2][1] documentation provided by Amazon.

## Prerequisites

You must have the following resources available to complete the Amazon Pay setup in the Magento Admin:

- A verified Amazon Pay merchant account ([https://pay.amazon.com/signup][4])
- [Amazon Pay seller credentials][5]

## Connect to Amazon Pay

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the upper-left corner, set the **Scope** to establish where the Amazon Pay configuration applies.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Payment Methods**.

1. If needed, expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Other Payment Methods** section.

1. For _Amazon Pay_, click <span class="btn">Configure</span>.

   ![Sales configuration - Amazon Pay]({% link images/images/config-sales-payment-methods-amazon-pay.png %}){: .zoom}
   [_Amazon Pay_]({% link configuration/sales/amazon-pay.md %})

1. If you do not have your registered Amazon Pay account information, click <span class="btn">Get started with account registration</span> to register a new account through Amazon Seller Central.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Do not use your personal Amazon account for Amazon Pay.

1. When you have your account information, complete the following sections.

## Credentials

Your credentials are transferred automatically from your Amazon Pay account to the Magento Admin. Your credentials can also be found in Amazon Seller Central in both Production and Sandbox modes.

### Configure credentials for Sandbox mode

1. Get your Test Credentials for the Amazon Pay Sandbox.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Credentials** section.

   ![Sales configuration - Amazon Pay credentials]({% link images/images/config-sales-payment-methods-amazon-pay-credentials.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Amazon Pay credentials_

1. Select the **Test Credentials** checkbox.

1. Use one of these methods for supplying the account credentials:

   - Enter the following credentials that you copied from Amazon Seller Central:

      - **Merchant Id**
      - **Access Key Id**
      - **Secret Access Key**
      - **Client ID**
      - **Client Secret**

   - For **Credentials JSON**, enter the JSON string of all Amazon Pay seller credentials.

      This JSON will be used to set values for Merchant Id, Access Key Id, Secret Access Key, Client Id, and Client Secret on save and clear any of the values that were entered manually.

1. Set **Sandbox** to `Yes`.

1. Set the **Payment Region** for the store.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span> to validate the supplied credentials.

   Look for the message, _Your Amazon configuration is valid_ at the top of the Configuration page.

   If your credentials are valid, continue with the configuration. Otherwise, correct your credentials and try again.

### Change credentials for Production mode

When you are through testing and ready to go live with Amazon Pay, return to the configuration and modify the settings:

1. Clear the **Test Credentials** checkbox.
1. Set Sandbox to `No`.
1. Click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

## Options

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Options** section.

1. Set **Enable Amazon Pay** to `Yes`.

   | Charge on Order | Amazon creates the invoice and charges the customer when the order is placed. |

1. Set **Authorization Mode** to determine the method that is used to transmit authorization data.

   | Immediate | (Default) Makes the disposition of an authorization available within a couple of seconds. |
   | Automatic | (Recommended) Uses synchronous authorization, if possible, and switches to asynchronous processing as needed for some declines. The change in processing modes is transparent to the user. The status of sales order is _Pending_ while the disposition of authorization is outstanding. |

1. Set **Update Mechanism** to one of the following:

   | Data Polling via Cron job | (Default) Uses the standard Magento notification process that is scheduled by [Cron]({% link system/cron.md %}) job. |
   | Instant Payment Notifications | (IPN) Sends notifications to the Instant Payment Notification URL. |
