Magento includes a number of built-in offline payment methods, which do not require the services of a third-party payment processing company:

- [Zero Subtotal Checkout]({% link payment/zero-subtotal-checkout.md %})
- [Cash On Delivery Payment]({% link payment/cash-on-delivery.md %})
- [Bank Transfer Payment]({% link payment/bank-transfer.md %})
- [Check / Money Order]({% link payment/check-money-order.md %})
- [Purchase Order]({% link payment/purchase-order.md %})
- {:.b2b-only}[Payment on Account]({% link payment/payment-on-account.md %})
