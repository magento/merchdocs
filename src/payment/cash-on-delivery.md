title: Cash On Delivery

Magento allows you to accept COD payments for purchases. You can accept COD payment from only specific countries, and fine-tune the configuration with minimum and maximum order total limits.

The shipping carrier receives payment from the customer at the time of delivery, which is then transferred to you. You can make an adjustment for any fee charged by the carrier service in your shipping and handling charges.
