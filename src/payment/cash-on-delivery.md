title: Cash On Delivery
---

Magento allows you to accept CODÂ payments for purchases. You can accept COD payment only from specific countries, and you can fine-tune the configuration with minimum and maximum order total limits.

The shipping carrier receives payment from the customer at the time of delivery, which is then transferred to you. You can make an adjustment for any fee charged by the carrier service in your shipping and handling charges.

1. Set **Payment from Applicable Countries** to one of the following:

   |All Allowed Countries |Customers from all [countries]({% link stores/country-options.md %}) specified in your store configuration can use this payment method. |
   |Specific Countries |After you choose this option, the _Payment from Specific Countries_ list appears. To select multiple countries, hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) and click each option. |

   An order qualifies if the total is between, or matches, the minimum or maximum order total.

1. Enter a **Sort Order** number to determine the position of this item in the list of payment methods that is displayed during checkout.

   This is relative to the other payment methods. (`0` = first, `1` = second, `2` = third, and so on.)

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
