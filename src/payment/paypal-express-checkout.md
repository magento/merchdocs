PayPal Express Checkout helps boost sales by giving your customers the ability to pay by credit card or from the security of their personal PayPal accounts. During checkout, the customer is redirected to the secure PayPal site to complete the payment information. The customer is then returned to your store to complete the remainder of the checkout process. Choosing Express Checkout adds the familiar PayPal button to your store, which has been reported to increase sales.

**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. No action is needed for PayPal Express Checkout to comply with PSD2 because all requirements are handled by PayPal.

Customers with current PayPal accounts can make a purchase in a single step by clicking the _Check out with PayPal_ button. Express Checkout can be used as a standalone, or in combination with one of the PayPal all-in-one solutions. If you already accept credit cards online, you can offer Express Checkout as an additional option to attract new customers who prefer to pay with PayPal.

{:.bs-callout-info}
PayPal has deprecated support for the sale of digital goods through PayPal Express Checkout and recommends that you use either [PayPal Payments Standard]({% link payment/paypal-payments-standard.md %}) or any other PayPal payment gateway to process any order that includes [virtual products]({% link catalog/product-create-virtual.md %}).

## Requirements

- Merchant: [Business PayPal account][1]
- Customer: [Personal PayPal account][2]

## Express checkout workflow

Unlike other payment methods, PayPal Express Checkout allows the customer to check out at the beginning of the usual checkout workflow from the product page, the mini shopping cart, and shopping cart.

| **1** |**Customer places order** | The customer clicks/taps the _Check out with PayPal_ button.|
| **2** | **Customer is redirected to PayPal site** | The customer is redirected to the PayPal site to complete the transaction.|
| **3** | **Customer logs in to their PayPal account** | The customer must log in to their PayPal account to complete the transaction. The payment system uses the billing and shipping information from their PayPal account.|
| **4** | **Customer returns to the checkout page** | The customer is redirected back to the checkout page in your store to review the order.|
| **5** | **Customer places order** | The customer places the order, and the order information is submitted to PayPal.|
| **6** | **PayPal settles the transaction** | PayPal receives the order and settles the transaction.|

{:.bs-callout-info}
PayPal Express Checkout does not support orders with multiple-addresses.

## In-context checkout

PayPal’s _In-Context Checkout_ makes it easier than ever to pay online. Customers never lose sight of your store during this simplified one- or two-click seamless checkout. In-context checkout works equally well on Macs and PCs, and offers a consistent experience on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices. To learn more, see [In-Context Checkout in Express Checkout][5].
