title: Managing Amazon Pay Transactions
---

All purchases made in your store and processed by Amazon Pay can be viewed from the Amazon Pay website. If you receive a request for a refund, follow the normal Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source process to issue a [credit memo]({% link sales/credit-memos.md %}) and make a refund. The credit memo option is available after a sales order is invoiced.
