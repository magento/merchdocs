title: PayPal Fraud Management Filter
---

PayPal fraud management filters make it easier to detect and respond to fraudulent transactions, and can be configured to flag, hold for review, or deny riskier payments. Magento [order status]({% link sales/order-status.md %}) values changed according to the fraud filter settings.

## Filter actions

| Action | Result|
| --- | --- |
| Review | The suspected order receives the status _Payment Review_ when the order is placed. You can review the order and approve, or cancel the payment in the Admin, or on the PayPal side. When you click **Accept Payment** or **Deny Payment**, no new transactions for the order are created. <br/><br/>If you change the status of the transaction on the PayPal site, you must click **Get Payment Update** in the Order page of the Admin to apply the changes. If you click **Accept Payment** or **Deny Payment**, the changes made at the PayPal site are applied. |
| Deny | The suspected order cannot be placed by the customer, because the corresponding transaction is rejected by PayPal. <br/><br/>To deny the payment from the Admin, click **Deny Payment** in the upper-right corner of the page. The order status changes to _Canceled_, the transaction is reverted, and funds are released on the customer account. The corresponding information is added in the _Comments History_ section of the order view. |
| Flag | The suspected order gets the status _Processing_ when it is placed. The corresponding transaction is marked with a flag in the list of the merchant account transactions. |
