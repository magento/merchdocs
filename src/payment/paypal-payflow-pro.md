| **2** | **Customer submits order** | The customer submits the order, and the order information is sent to PayPal for processing. The customer does not leave the checkout page of your site.|
| **3** | **PayPal completes the transaction** | Payments are accepted at the time the order is placed. Depending on the payment action specified n the configuration, either a sales order or a sales order and an invoice is created. |

## Online order processing workflow

| **1** | **Administrator submits online invoice** | The store administrator submits an online invoice. and as a result a corresponding transaction and an invoice is created.|
| **2** | **PayPal receives the transaction** | The order information is sent to PayPal. A record of the transaction and an invoice is generated. You can view all Payflow Pro Gateway transactions in your [PayPal merchant account][2].|
