{:.bs-callout-warning}
**Payment Services Directive Requirements:** <br/>
As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2]({% link stores/compliance-payment-services-directive.md %}) requirements. To comply with PSD2, PayPal Payments Advanced must be integrated with Cardinal Commerce. To learn more, see [3-D Secure for Payflow](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/payflow/3d-secure-overview/).

PayPal Payments Advanced is a [PCI-compliant]({% link stores/compliance-pci.md %}) solution that lets your customers pay by debit or credit card without leaving your site. It includes an embedded checkout page that can be customized to create a seamless and secure checkout experience.

Even customers without a PayPal account can make purchases through PayPal’s secure payment gateway. Accepted cards include Visa, MasterCard, Switch/Maestro, and Solo credit cards in the United States and United Kingdom. For additional convenience, PayPal Express Checkout is included with PayPal Payments Advanced.

You can have two PayPal solutions active at the same time: Express Checkout, plus any All-In-One or Payment Gateway solution. If you change payment solutions, the one that was used previously is disabled.

{:.bs-callout-info}
PayPal Payments Advanced cannot be used for orders created from the Admin of your store.

## Requirements

- [PayPal Business Account][1]
- If you manage multiple Magento websites, you must have a separate PayPal merchant account for each website.

## Checkout Workflow

| **1** | **Customer Chooses Payment Method**| During checkout, the customer chooses to pay with PayPal Payments Advanced. The Pay Now button appears instead of the Place Order button.|
| **2** | **Pay Now** | The customer taps Pay Now, and a PayPal-hosted form appears. The customer enters the card information, and the card is verified. If successful, the order confirmation page appears.
| | **Pay with PayPal** | The form also includes the Pay with PayPal button, which redirects the customer to the PayPal site, where payment can be made with PayPal Express Checkout.|
| **4** | **Troubleshooting** | If the transaction fails for any reason, an error message appears on the checkout page and the customer is instructed to try again. Any issues are managed by PayPal.|

## Order Processing Workflow

Processing orders with PayPal Payments Advanced is the same as for any regular PayPal order. Orders are invoiced and shipped, and credit memos generated for both online and offline refunds. However, multiple online refunds are not available for orders paid with PayPal Payments Advanced.

| **1** | **Customer Places Order** | In the final stage of checkout, the customer taps the Place Order button. |
| **2** | **PayPal Responds** | PayPal evaluates the request. If found to be valid, PayPal processes the transaction.|
| **3** | **Magento Sets Order Status** | Magento receives response from PayPal, and sets the order status to one of the following:<br/>**Processing** - The transaction was successful.<br/>**Pending Payment** - The system did not receive any response from PayPal.<br/>**Canceled** - The transaction was not successful for some reason.<br/>**Suspected Fraud** -  The transaction did not pass some of the [PayPal fraud filters]({% link payment/paypal-fraud-management-filter.md %}). The system receives the response from PayPal that the transaction is under review by Fraud Service.
| **4** | **Merchant Fulfills Order** | The merchant invoices and ships the order.|
