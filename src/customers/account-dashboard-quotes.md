If quotes are enabled, the My Quotes section of the account lists all quotes submitted by the customer. Depending on their permissions, only buyers who make purchases on behalf of a company can submit requests to negotiate the price of a purchase.

_My Quotes_

The buyer begins the process by [submitting a request]({% link sales/quote-request.md %}) for a quote from the shopping cart. Email is exchanged between the buyer and seller during the [negotiation process]({% link sales/quote-price-negotiation.md %}). For the buyer, the My Quotes page is the focal point for all communication between buyer and seller during the negotiation process. A buyer who accepts the negotiated price offered by the seller can proceed directly to checkout from the quote. Additional discounts cannot be added to the negotiated quote.
