A 'SKU' is a 'Stock Keeping Unit'. SKUs generally help online sellers identify the most important product characteristics such as: size, color, price, material etc. Product IDs are different than SKUs:

    - The `Product ID` is sequential series of numbers that are used internally to identify products and are not available to customers.
    - The `SKU` is generated by the seller, normally based on the product name and attributes for marketing or internal tracking. e.g. A blue, cotton T-shirt, size medium: T-COT-MED-BL. The SKU may be changed by the seller if required.

Normally, a SKU includes a set of abbreviations indicating the distinguishing characteristics of the product. The maximum SKU length is 64 characters. SKUs are very important to effectively track and manage inventory, so setting them up correctly is critical for e-commerce.

[Order by SKU]({% link sales/order-by-sku.md %}) gives you the ability to add individual products to your cart by SKU and quantity, or import a list of products from a file.
