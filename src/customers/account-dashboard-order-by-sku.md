title: Order by SKU
---

SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit. SKUs help online sellers identify the most important product characteristics such as: size, color, price, material etc. Don't confuse product IDs with SKUs:

    - The `Product ID` is a set of numbers that are used internally to identify products and are not available to customers.
    - The `SKU` is generated by the seller based on the product name and attributes for marketing or internal tracking.
    
Basically, an article number includes a set of abbreviations indicating the distinguishing characteristics of the product. The maximum SKU length in Magento 2 is 64 characters. SKUs are very important to effectively track and manage inventory, so setting them up correctly is critical for e-commerce.

[Order by SKU]({% link sales/order-by-sku.md %}) gives you the ability to add individual products to your cart by SKU and quantity, or import a list of products from a file.
