Reorders are available to customers when the [_Allow Reorder_]({% link sales/reorders-allow.md %}) configuration option is enabled.

A customer can initiate the reorder functionality for a specific order from two pages:

- My Orders page
- Order View page

## Reorder from My Orders page

The _Reorder_ button is displayed in the list with Orders near the _View_ button.
