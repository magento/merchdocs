title: Resetting Passwords
---

Customers usually reset their passwords from the storefront by clicking the “Forgot Your Password?” link. However, the store administrator can initiate either a password reset or a forced sign-in from the Admin.

|Reset Password | A password reset email is sent directly to the customer’s email account. At no time does the store administrator gain access to the customer’s password.|
|Force Sign In | Revokes the OAuth access tokens that are associated with the customer account. This can be used only with customer accounts that have been assigned OAuth tokens, as part of a Web API [integration]({% link system/integrations.md %}). To learn more, see [OAuth-based authentication](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-oauth.html) in the Magento DevDocs. <br/><br/>**_Note:_** Standard customer accounts created from the storefront or from the Admin do not have OAuth tokens.|
