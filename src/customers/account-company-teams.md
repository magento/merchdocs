The structure of a company account should reflect the purchasing organization, whether it is simple and flat or a complex organization with different teams for each subdivision and division of the company.

If your installation is [configured]({% link stores/b2b-features.md %}) to allow companies to manage their own accounts, setting up the company structure is one of the first tasks for a company administrator to complete after the account is approved. In the company account, the structure of the company is represented as a tree with the company administrator at the top.
