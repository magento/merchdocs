title: Approval Rules
---

Most companies have order approval rules for purchase orders. Companies can control who can create purchase orders and how much they can spend.
For example:

* Any PO less than X value is automatically approved.
* POs over X value but less than Q must be approved by Y.
* Any PO over X value must be approved by Y and Z.
* A PO created by anyone at the Director level or above is automatically approved.

With the required [permissions for their role]({% link customers/account-company-roles-permissions.md %}), B2B customers can set up approval rules to enforce company policies. This also requires a defined [company structure]({% link customers/account-company-structure.md %}) in order to specify approval by the purchaser's manager.

To access the approval rules for your company, click **Approval Rules** in the left panel for your customer account.

Depending on the company role and permissions, users may have the option to edit, delete, or view approval rules.

## Purchase order payment methods

Purchase order approval supports both online and offline payment methods.
All default offline payment methods are supported for purchase order approvals.

For online payments, the following methods are supported:

* Paypal Express
* Braintree payments

{:.bs-callout-info}
Purchase orders should use an _In-Context_ checkout experience. _Out-of-Context_ checkouts are not supported because they bypass the normal checkout flow.
Generally, _In-Context_ means the customer stays on the Magento site to complete the process. _Out-of-Context_ is when the customer is taken to another site to complete the purchase.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Using gift cards, store credit, or reward points with online payment methods for purchase orders is not supported. Enabling these features with online payments may cause some unexpected behavior. It is recommended to disable gift cards, store credit, and reward points when online payments are enabled for purchase orders.
