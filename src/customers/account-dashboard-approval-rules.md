Most companies have [order approval]({% link stores/b2b-features.md %}#configure-order-approval) rules for purchase orders. Companies can control who can create purchase orders and how much they can spend.
For example:

* Any PO less than X value is automatically approved.
* POs over X value but less than Q must be approved by Y.
* Any PO over X value must be approved by Y and Z.
* A PO created by anyone at the Director level or above is automatically approved.

With the required [permissions for their role]({% link customers/account-company-roles-permissions.md %}), B2B customers can set up approval rules to enforce company policies. This also requires a defined [company structure]({% link customers/account-company-structure.md %}) in order to specify approval by the purchaser's manager.

To access the approval rules for your company, click **Approval Rules** in the left panel for your customer account.

Depending on the company role and permissions, users may have the option to edit, delete, or view approval rules.

## Purchase order payment methods

Purchase order approval supports both online and offline payment methods.
All default offline payment methods are supported for purchase order approvals.

For online payments, the following methods are supported:

* Paypal Express
* Braintree payments

{:.bs-callout-info}
Purchase orders should use an _In-Context_ checkout experience. _Out-of-Context_ checkouts are not supported because they bypass the normal checkout flow.
Generally, _In-Context_ means the customer stays on the your commerce site to complete the process. _Out-of-Context_ is when the customer is taken to another site to complete the purchase.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Using gift cards, store credit, or reward points with online payment methods for purchase orders is not supported. Enabling these features with online payments may cause some unexpected behavior. It is recommended to disable gift cards, store credit, and reward points when online payments are enabled for purchase orders.

_Creating a new approval rule_

1. Click <span class="btn">Add New Rule<span> to create a new rule.

1. If needed, change the rule from **Enabled** to **Disabled**.

   The rule is set to be enabled as the default, but you can create the rule using a disabled setting and then enable it later when you are ready to enforce it.

1. For **Rule name**, enter a short but descriptive name for the Rule, such as `Orders less than $100`.

   Rule names must be unique.

1. For **Description**, enter a longer explanation of the rule.

1. For **Applies to**, choose the company role(s) that this rule will apply to.

1. Choose the **Rule Type** and define the rule.

   See the following sections for a detailed explanation and example for each rule type.

1. For **Requires approval from** choose the required approver(s) according to the type of approval you want for the rule.

   <div class="bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
   * When assigning a role as an approver, ensure that there is at least one user in that role.
   * If there are two or more users with the same approver role, the creator of the purchase order cannot approve it. In this case, manual approval is required by any other user with this approver role. However, if `Auto-approve POs created within this role` option is set in the [Role Permissions]({% link customers/account-company-roles-permissions.md %}), the purchase order is approved automatically.
   * If there is only one user with the approver role and that user is the creator, the purchase order is always approved automatically -- the `Auto-approve POs created within this role` permission setting is ignored.
