title: Negotiating a Quote
---

When the seller responds to your request for a quote, the status of the quote changes to `Updated`. Look for an email notification from the store with the reply from the seller. The email includes a link to your account, and the expiration date of the quote. A quote can be changed and resubmitted, even if it was declined or after it has expired.

When a quote is opened, the prices are verified to reflect the current shared catalog prices, cart rules, taxes, and applicable cart discounts. The price verification is performed on unlocked quotes with a status of `New`, `Updated`, or `Open`.

## Step 1: Open the updated quote

1. Do one of the following:

    - If you are already logged in to your account, click the link in the email.
    - Log in to your account.

1. In the account sidebar, choose **My Quotes**.

## Step 3: Reply to the seller

Make any of the following changes to the quote:

### Change the shipping address

1. To choose a different address from your [address book]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %}), do the following:

    - Go to the **Shipping Information** section and click **Select Existing Address**.
    - Choose an address from your [Address Book]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %}).
    - When prompted to confirm, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

1. To add a new address, click **Add New Address**.

    - Add the new address to your [Address Book]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %}).

    If the shipping address is changed during a price negotiation, the quote must be sent back to the seller for review.

### Attach a file

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the quote and click **Attach file**.

1. Choose the file from the directory.

### Close the quote

1. To end the negotiation, add a **Comment** that explains why you are closing the quote.

1. In the header section of the quote, click **Close quote**.

    The quote is remains in the My Quotes list in your account, with a status of `Closed`.

### Delete the quote

1. In the header section of the quote, click **Delete**.

    The quote is removed from the My Quotes list in your account.

1. Add a **Comment** that briefly explains any changes to the quote.

1. To send your reply to the seller, click <span class="btn">Send for Review</span>.

   The status of the quote changes to `Submitted`. You can view the quote, but you are unable to make any changes until you receive a reply from the seller.

   You can repeat the negotiation process as many times as necessary to reach an agreement.

## Step 4: Place the order

1. To complete the purchase, click <span class="btn">Proceed to Checkout</span>.

1. Follow the normal [checkout process]({% link sales/checkout-process.md %}).

    This order is within the company’s available credit limit and is being [charged to their account]({% link payment/payment-on-account.md %}). The _Order Summary_ section shows the quote subtotal, shipping and the total amount that is to be charged to their account. Because tax is not applicable to this order, it is not included in the Order Summary.
