title: Stored Payment Methods
---

Customers with access to a secure vault for storing payment information can speed through checkout without entering their credit card information each time. If [Instant Purchase]({% link sales/checkout-instant-purchase.md %}) is enabled, customers can bypass the two-step checkout process and place the order from the product page.

A payment method that supports a secure vault, such as [Braintree]({% link payment/braintree.md %}), is required. When a secure vault is enabled in the payment method configuration, customers will have the option during checkout to save their credit card information as a stored payment method. Customers can manage stored payment methods from their account dashboard.
