title: Approving a Company Account
---

The status of requests received from the storefront to create a company are “Pending Approval” until the request is reviewed by the store administrator, and either approved or rejected. The status of a company account might be set to any of the following:

- Active
- Pending Approval
- Rejected
- Blocked

You can also use the [Actions control]({% link customers/account-company-manage.md %}) to approve multiple company requests. New company requests are easy to find, because they appear at the top of the list in the Companies grid.

## Approve a pending company account

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Customers** > **Companies**.

   All pending requests appear at the top of the list. To make them more noticeable, you can adjust the [grid layout]({% link stores/admin-grid-layout.md %}) to include the _Status_ column.

1. In the _Action_ column, click **Edit**.

1. Set **Company Status** to `Active`.

1. When prompted to confirm, click <span class="btn">Change status</span>.

   The company administrator receives notification that the company is now active.

1. If applicable, set **Sales Representative** to a specific Admin account.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Account Information** section and use the **Comment** field to enter notes about the account.

   The comments are not visible from the storefront.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

   A confirmation email is sent to the company and company administrator with instructions to set the account password.
