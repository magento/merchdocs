   - Set **Default Group** to the customer group that is assigned to new customers when an account is created.

   - If you have a Value Added Tax number and want it to be visible to customers, set **Show VAT Number on Storefront** to `Yes`.

   - To require a customer's email during Admin order creation for a customer, set **Email is required field for Admin order creation** to `Yes`.
