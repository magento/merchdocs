_Company Structure with Teams of Users_

Company users are assigned by the company administrator, and are visible from the Admin in the Customers grid. For each user, the company administrator first sets up the [company structure]({% link customers/account-company-structure.md %}), and then completes the following tasks, as needed:

- Create company users and assign users to teams

- Define roles and permissions, and assign users to roles

## Add company users

1. From the storefront, sign in to your account as the company administrator.

1. In the left panel, choose **Company Users**.

   _Company Users_

1. Click <span class="btn">Add New User</span> and do the following:

   - Enter the **Job Title** of the new user.

   - If the roles and permissions are defined, choose the appropriate **User Role**. Otherwise, you can return later to assign the role.

      _Add new user_

   - Complete the remaining fields as needed for the user:

      - **First Name** and **Last Name**
      - **Email**
      - **Phone Number**

   - By default, the **Status** of the account is `Active`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

1. Repeat the process to create as many company users as needed.

   The new users appear in the Company Users list, along with the Company Administrator.

To save time during their first order, the company administrator can remind each company user to add the default company billing and shipping address to their [address book]({% link customers/account-dashboard-address-book.md %}).

## Remove a company user

Company users can be removed only by the company administrator, and the removal cannot be reversed. The user is removed from the company structure.

1. Select the company user in the company structure.

1. Click **Delete Selected**.
