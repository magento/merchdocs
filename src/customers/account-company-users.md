The individuals who are associated with a company are represented in the Customers grid by the customer type, _Company User_, and are typically buyers with varying levels of permission to access store services and resources.

_Company Structure with Teams of Users_

Company users are assigned by the company administrator, and are visible from the Admin in the Customers grid. For each user, the company administrator first sets up the [company structure]({% link customers/account-company-structure.md %}), and then completes the following tasks, as needed:

- Create company users and assign users to teams

- Define roles and permissions, and assign users to roles

Company users can be added, edited, or removed only by the company administrator. Removal cannot be reversed because the user is removed from the company structure.

## Add company users

1. From the storefront, the company administrator signs in to their account.

1. In the left panel, chooses **Company Users**.
