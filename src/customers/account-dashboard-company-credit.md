The [Company Credit]({% link customers/credit-company.md %}) section of the customerâ€™s account displays the current outstanding balance, available credit, and the credit limit that is allocated to their account followed by a list of outstanding invoices.

If the seller cancels an order that was charged to company credit, the amount of the order is returned to the company balance and a record of the action is added to Credit Allocation History.
