title: Company Roles and Permissions
---

Roles for company users set up with various levels of permission to access sales information and resources. By default, the company administrator is a super user with full permissions. The [Access Denied]({% link cms/pages-core.md %}) page appears if the user does not have permission to access the page.

The system has one predefined Default User role, which you can use “as is" or modify to suit your needs. You can create as many roles as necessary to match your company structure.

- **Default User** — The default user has full access to activities related to sales and quotes, and view-only access to company profile and credit information.

- **Senior Buyer** — A senior buyer might have access to all Sales and Quotes resources, and view-only permissions to the Company Profile, User and Teams, Payment Information, and Company Credit.

- **Assistant Buyer** — An assistant buyer might have permission to place an order using Checkout with Quote, and to view orders, quotes, and information in the company profile.
