title: Sales Representative
---

The sales representative is an [Admin user]({% link system/permissions.md %}) who is assigned as the point of contact for a company account and receives all automated [email messages]({% link marketing/email-company-configuration.md %}) related to the company. Only one sales representative can be assigned per company account, but a single sales representative can manage multiple company accounts. The default admin account is assigned as the sales representative, unless a different admin user is assigned.

The name and email address of the assigned sales representative is visible to company members from the company account and quotes page.

1. Find the company in the grid and open in edit mode.

1. Set **Sales Representative** to the Admin user that you want to assign as the point of contact for the company.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

   The assigned sales representative receives email notification of the assignment.
