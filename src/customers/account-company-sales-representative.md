The sales representative is an [Admin user]({% link system/permissions.md %}) who is assigned as the point of contact for a company account and receives all automated [email messages]({% link marketing/email-company-configuration.md %}) related to the company. Only one sales representative can be assigned per company account, but a single sales representative can manage multiple company accounts. The default admin account is assigned as the sales representative, unless a different admin user is assigned.

The name and email address of the assigned sales representative is visible to company members from the company account and quotes page.

## Assign a sales representative

1. Find the company in the grid and open in edit mode.

1. Set **Sales Representative** to the Admin user that you want to assign as the point of contact for the company.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

   The assigned sales representative receives email notification of the assignment.
