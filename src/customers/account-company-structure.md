A company account can be set up to reflect the structure of the business. Initially, the company structure includes only the company administrator, but can be expanded to include teams of users. The users can be associated with teams or organized within a hierarchy of divisions and subdivisions within the company.

In the customer’s account dashboard, the company structure is represented as a tree and initially consists of only the company administrator.

_Company Structure with Company Administrator_

When the account is created, the company administrator can use the company email address or be assigned a different email address.

It is possible that the person who serves as company administrator has multiple roles within the company. If a separate email address is entered for the company administrator, the initial company structure includes the company administrator plus an individual user account in the name of the company administrator. In such a case, the company administrator can sign in to the account as the company or as an individual user.

The full company structure is reflected in the Companies and Customers grids. The Companies grid lists all companies regardless of status. The following example shows accounts for two companies: the “ABC Company” and the “XYZ Company”.

After creating the account, the company administrator must define the company structure of [teams]({% link customers/account-company-teams.md %}), set up the [company users]({% link customers/account-company-users.md %}), and establish [roles and permissions]({% link customers/account-company-roles-permissions.md %}) for each.
