title: Creating a Company Account
---

Company accounts can be set up from the storefront by the customer, or from the Admin. All requests to create a company account must be approved by the store administrator before the account becomes active.

The person who sets up a company account from the storefront is usually assigned a role as the [company administrator]({% link customers/account-company-admin.md %}). After the request to create a company account is approved, the company administrator can set an account password and log in to the account.
