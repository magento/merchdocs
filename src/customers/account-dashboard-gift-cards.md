title: Gift Card
---

A *gift card* is a code consisting of letters and numbers, such as *HAPPYBD_GC12*, that allows customers to buy gift cards and send them to friends by email or regular mail. Store owners can create unlimited gift cards with different pricing models ([product type]({% link catalog/product-gift-card.md %})) and easily track all purchased cards.

How gift cards work on the storefront:

- The gift card code can be applied in the cart or at checkout to cover the total amount of the order.

- In the catalog, a gift card is presented as a separate type of product.

- The gift card code is activated after the order is invoiced. If the order is not paid, the receiving customer cannot use the gift card.

- Accounts for gift codes are created to track the balance of a specific voucher. A store administrator can manually adjust the balance.

The Gift Card section of your account dashboard can be used to check the balance of your [gift card account]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-accounts.md %}) and redeem gift cards for [store credit]({% link customers/store-credit-using.md %}).
