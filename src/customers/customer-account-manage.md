title: Managing Customer Accounts
---

Use the Customers grid to find any customer account. You can use the standard [workplace controls]({% link stores/admin-workspace.md %}) to filter the list, change the [column layout]({% link stores/admin-grid-layout.md %}), save views, and export data. The [Actions control]({% link stores/admin-actions-control.md %}) above the grid can be used to apply an operation to multiple customer records.
