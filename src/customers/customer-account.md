title: Customer Accounts
---

The header of every page in your store extends an invitation for shoppers to _Log in or register_ for an account with your store. Customers who open an account enjoy a range of benefits, including:

<!--{% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %}-->
- **Create Individual or Company Account** — Depending on the configuration, a visitor to your store can choose to create either an individual or company account.
<!--{% endif %}-->
- **Faster checkout** — Registered customers move through checkout faster because much of the information is already in their accounts.
- **Self service** — Registered customers can update their information, check the status of orders, and even reorder from their accounts.

<!--{% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %}-->
For B2B installations of Magento Commerce, there are two basic types of accounts that can be created: Individual and [company]({% link customers/account-companies.md %}) accounts.

- Individual — An [individual]({% link customers/account-create.md %}) customer account is similar to a standard Magento customer account.
- Company — A [company]({% link customers/account-companies.md %}) account can be set up as a structure with teams od multiple users.
<!--{% endif %}-->

Customers can access their account by clicking the **My Account** link in the header of the store. From their account, customers can view and modify information, including past and current addresses, billing and shipping preferences, newsletter subscriptions, wish list, and more.
