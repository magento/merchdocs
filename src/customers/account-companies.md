When you incorporate [B2B]({% link configuration/general/b2b-features.md  %}) company accounts in your store, you can simplify the corporate shopping experience by enabling companies to create multiple sub-accounts with flexible permissions based on user roles in their organization. Depending on the customer groups of the company, a store administrator can adjust promotions and prices to suit their needs, and create highly customized offers that cater to the shoppersâ€™ demands and increase orders. Adding a company account association to a standard [individual]({% link customers/account-create.md %}) allows the customer to use the specific purchasing workflows defined for the company.

Advantages of a company account:

- Offers unlimited [company users]({% link customers/account-company-users.md %}) and the creation of additional accounts, thereby simplifying corporate purchases.

- Includes support for a "smart" company account hierarchy with different [roles and permissions]({% link customers/account-company-roles-permissions.md %}) for placing orders.

- Provides a mechanism for merchants to increase income by offering [company store credit]({% link customers/account-dashboard-company-credit.md %}) as a payment method.

- Supports the [management]({% link customers/account-company-manage.md %}) of all company accounts in the Admin.

## View company accounts

The _Companies_ grid lists all active company accounts and pending requests, regardless of status setting. It also provides the tools needed to [create]({% link customers/account-company-create.md %}) and [manage]({% link customers/account-company-manage.md %}) company accounts. Use the standard [grid controls]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) to filter the list, and adjust the column layout.

Customers can create a new company accounts from the storefront, or a merchant can create one from the Admin. By default, the ability to create company accounts from the storefront is enabled. If allowed by the configuration, a visitor to the store can request to open a company account. After the company account is approved, the company administrator can set up the company structure and users with various levels of permission.

In the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Customers** > **Companies**.
