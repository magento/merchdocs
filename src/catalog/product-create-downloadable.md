title: Downloadable Product
---

A downloadable product can be anything that you can deliver as a file, such as an eBook, music, video, software application, or update. You can offer an album for sale and sell each song individually. You can also use a downloadable product to deliver an electronic version of your product catalog.

Because the actual download is not available until after the purchase, you can provide samples, such as an excerpt from a book, a clip from an audio file, or a trailer from a video that the customer can try before purchasing the product. The files that you make available for download can be either uploaded to your server or from a different server.

_Downloadable Product_

Downloadable products can be configured to require that the customer log in to an account to receive the link or can be sent by email and shared with others. The status of the order before the download becomes available, default values, and other delivery options are set in the configuration. Fore more information, see [Download Options]({% link catalog/product-download-options.md %}).

The following instructions demonstrate the process of creating a downloadable product using a [product template]({% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}), required fields, and basic settings. Each required field is marked with a red asterisk (`*`). When you finish the basics, you can complete the [advanced settings]({% link catalog/settings-advanced.md %}) and [other settings]({% link catalog/settings-other.md %}) as needed.

To choose the attribute set that is used as a template for the product, do one of the following:

- For **Search**, enter the name of the attribute set.
