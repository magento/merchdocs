If you go to the expense of creating your own original product images, there is not much you can do to prevent unscrupulous competitors from stealing them with the click of a mouse. However, you can make them a less attractive target by placing a watermark on each image to identify them as your property. A watermark file can be either a JPG (JPEG), GIF, or PNG image. Both GIF and PNG file types support transparent layers, which can be used to give the watermark a transparent background.

The watermark used for the _small_ image in the following example is a black logo with a transparent background and saved as a PNG file with the following settings:

- Size: 50x50
- Opacity: 5
- Position: Tile
