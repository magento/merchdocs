When [Live Search]({% link live-search/quick-tour.md %}) is installed, the search box returns "search as you type" results in a popover.

The Search box in the header of the store helps visitors find products in your catalog. The search text can be the full or partial product name or any other word or phrase that describes the product. The search terms that people use to find products can be managed from the Admin.

1. For **Search**, enter the first few letters of what you want to find.

    Any matches in the catalog appear below, with the number of results found.

1. Either press the **Enter** key or click a result in the list of matching products.
