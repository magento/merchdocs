Display Settings determine which content elements appear on a category page and the order in which products appear. You can enable CMS blocks, set the anchor status of the category, and manage sorting options from the _Display Settings_ tab. For examples of how categories are reflected in the storefront, see [Catalog Navigation]({% link catalog/navigation.md %}).
