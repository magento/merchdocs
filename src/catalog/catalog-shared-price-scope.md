title: Configuring Catalog Price Scope
---

If you have a multisite installation, make sure to configure the price scope before you create your shared catalogs. The [price scope]({% link catalog/catalog-price-scope.md %}) can be set to `Global` or `Website`. However, it can be set only at the beginning of the setup process. The Website chooser appears during Step 2 of the [shared catalog setup]({% link catalog/catalog-shared-pricing-structure.md %}).
