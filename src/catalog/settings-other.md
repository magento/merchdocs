## General settings

|Section|Description|
|--- |--- |
|[Content]({% link catalog/product-content.md %})|This section is used to enter the main product description that appears on the product page. The short description can be used in most RSS feeds and might also appear in catalog listings, depending on theme. The product description can be formatted using the [editor]({% link cms/editor.md %}) toolbar.|
|[Product Reviews]({% link marketing/product-reviews.md %})|This section lists all reviews that customers have submitted about the product and only appears only after a new product has been saved.|
|[Images and Videos]({% link catalog/product-images-and-video.md %})|This section allows you to perform basic image management tasks such as upload multiple images, rearrange the order of images, and control how each image is used. For more control over individual images, you can open each image in `Detail View`.|
|[Search Engine Optimization]({% link catalog/product-search-engine-optimization.md %})|This section specifies the [URL Key]({% link catalog/catalog-urls.md %}) and [meta data]({% link marketing/meta-data.md %}) fields that are used by search engines to index the product. Although some search engines ignore meta keywords, others continue to use them. The current best practice is to incorporate high-value keywords in both the meta title and meta description.|
|[Related Products, Up-Sells, Cross-Sells]({% link catalog/related-products-up-sells-cross-sells.md %})|This section is used to set up simple promotional blocks that present a selection of additional products that might be of interest to the customer.|
|[Product Alerts]({% link catalog/inventory-product-alerts.md %})|This section displays subscriptions for two types of email alerts - price change alerts and stock availability alerts.|
|[Product in Websites]({% link catalog/settings-basic-websites.md %})|This section shows the current scope of the product within the store hierarchy.|
|[Design]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-design.md %})|These settings allow you to apply a different theme to the product page, change the column layout, determine where product options appear, and enter custom XML code.|
|[Gift Options]({% link catalog/product-gift-options.md %})|These options can be set at the product level to allow a gift message to be added to the product during checkout.|
|<span class="ce-only">[Scheduled Design Update]({% link catalog/product-scheduled-design-update.md %})</span>|This section allows you to apply a different theme to the product page, change the column layout, determine where product options appear, and enter custom XML code|
