There are two ways to assign a company to a shared catalog. You can make the assignment from the Shared Catalogs grid, or edit the company and assign the shared catalog as you would choose a customer group.

_Assign Companies_

## Method 1: Assign companies from shared catalogs

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Shared Catalogs**.

1. For the shared catalog in the [grid]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) where you want to assign a company, go to the **Action** column and select **Assign Companies**.

    The list of available companies appears in the grid. Companies that are already assigned to the catalog do not appear in the list.

    _Available Companies_

1. For the company that you want to assign to the shared catalog, go to the **Action** column and click **Assign**.

1. Repeat for each company that you want to assign to the shared catalog.

    The company is assigned to the shared catalog and is removed from the list of available companies.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

## Method 2: Edit the company

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Customers** > **Companies**.
