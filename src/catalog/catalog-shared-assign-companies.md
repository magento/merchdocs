There are two ways to assign a company to a shared catalog. You can make the assignment from the Shared Catalogs grid, or edit the company and assign the shared catalog as you would choose a customer group.

_Assign Companies_

## Method 1: Assign companies from shared catalogs

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Shared Catalogs**.

1. For the shared catalog in the [grid]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) where you want to assign a company, go to the **Action** column and select **Assign Companies**.

    The list of available companies appears in the grid. Companies that are already assigned to the catalog do not appear in the list.

    _Available Companies_

1. For the company that you want to assign to the shared catalog, go to the **Action** column and click **Assign**.

1. Repeat for each company that you want to assign to the shared catalog.

    The company is assigned to the shared catalog and is removed from the list of available companies.

## Method 2: Edit the company

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Customers** > **Companies**.
