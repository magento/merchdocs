The _Content_ settings determine any additional content appears on the category page. In addition to the list of category products, the page can include an image, description, and CMSÂ block. You can use the [Page Builder]({% link cms/page-builder.md %}) (<span class="ee-only"></span>) advanced content tools to define the category description.

## Page Builder preview

When you expand the _Content_ section for an existing category where there is content created with Page Builder, it displays a preview of the **Description** content as it would appear in the category page. Click the content area to open the Page Builder workspace, where you can make any needed updates.

_Description preview_

This content preview is enabled for the product and category forms by default. If performance suffers due to loading the preview, you can disable the preview in the [Content Management configuration]({% link configuration/general/content-management.md %}#advanced-content-tools) settings.
