After using [Google Content Experiments]({% link marketing/google-content-experiments.md %}) to set up a series of A/B tests, use the _Product View Optimization_ section to paste the snippet of code from Google into the original product that is to be tested.

This section appears only if **Google Content Experiments** is enabled in the [Google Analytics]({% link marketing/google-universal-analytics.md %}) Google API configuration.
