title: Bundle Product
---

A bundle is a “build your own,” customizable product. Each item in a bundle can be based on one of the following product types:

- [Simple Product]({% link catalog/product-create-simple.md %})
- [Virtual Product]({% link catalog/product-create-virtual.md %})

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Bundle Product_

The selection of options appears when the customer clicks either the _Customize_ and _Add to Cart_ button. Because the products that are included in the bundle vary, the SKU, Price, and Weight can be set to either a dynamic or fixed value.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) is not available for Bundle products with dynamic pricing.

If [Instant Purchase]({% link sales/checkout-instant-purchase.md %}) is available, the _Instant Purchase_ button appears below the Add to Cart button for each item in the bundle.

_Customize Bundle_

The following instructions take you through the process of creating a bundle product using a [product template]({% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}), required fields, and basic settings. Each required field is marked with a red asterisk (`*`). When you finish the basics, you can complete the [advanced settings]({% link catalog/settings-advanced.md %}) and [other settings]({% link catalog/settings-other.md %}) as needed.

## Step 1: Choose the Product Type

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. In the upper-right corner on the **Add Product** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-save-menu.png %}){: width="25px"} ) menu, choose **Bundle Product**.

    ![]({% link images/images/21product-add-bundle.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Add Bundle Product_

## Step 2: Choose the Attribute Set

To choose the [attribute set]({% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}) that is used as a template for the product, do one of the following:

- In the **Search** box, enter the name of the attribute set,
- In the list, choose the attribute set that you want to use.

The form is updated to reflect the change.

![]({% link images/images/product-create-choose-attribute-set.png %}){: .zoom}
_Choose Template_

## Step 3: Complete the Required Settings

1. Enter the product **Product Name**.

1. You can either accept the default **SKU** that is based on the product name, or enter a different value. To determine the type of SKU that is assigned to each bundle item, do the following:

    - A **Dynamic SKU** can be assigned automatically to each bundle item by adding a suffix to the default SKU. By default, this is set to `Yes`.
    - If you prefer to assign a unique SKU for each bundle item, set **Dynamic SKU** to `No` ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-switch-no.png %}){: .Inline}).

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-dynamic-sku-price.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Dynamic SKU and Price_

1. To determine the price of the bundle, do one of the following:

    - A **Dynamic Price** changes to reflect the options chosen by the customer. By default, this is set to `Yes` and the Price field is left blank.
    - To charge a fixed price for the bundle, set **Dynamic Price** to `No` ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-switch-no.png %}){: .Inline}). Then, enter the **Price** that you want to charge for the bundle.

1. Because the product is not yet ready to publish, set **Enable Product** to `No` ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-switch-no.png %}){: .Inline} ).

1. Click <span class="btn">Save</span> and continue.

    When the product is saved, the [Store View]({% link catalog/product-scope.md %}) chooser appears in the upper-left corner.

1. Choose the **Store View** where the product is to be available.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-create-store-view-choose.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Choose Store View_

## Step 4: Complete the Basic Settings

1. If the bundle has Fixed Pricing, set **Tax Class** to one of the following:

    - `None`
    - `Taxable Goods`

    If the bundle has Dynamic Pricing, the tax is determined for each bundle item.

1. Take note of the following:

    - The **Quantity** is not available because the value is determined for each bundle item.
    - The **Stock Status** is set by default to `In Stock`.

1. To determine the weight of the bundle, do one of the following:

    - A **Dynamic Weight** changes to reflect the options chosen by the customer. By default, Dynamic Weight is set to `Yes` and the Weight field is left blank.
    - To assign a fixed weight to the bundle, set **Dynamic Weight** to `No` ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-switch-no.png %}){: .Inline}). Then, enter the **Weight** of the bundle.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-dynamic-weight.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Dynamic Weight_

1. To feature the product in the list of[ new products]({% link cms/widget-new-products-list.md %}), select the **Set Product as New** checkbox.

1. Accept the default **Visibility** setting, `Catalog, Search`.

1. To assign **Categories** to the product, click the **Select…** box. Then, do either of the following:

    **Choose an existing category:**

    - Start typing in the box to find a match.

    - Select the checkbox of each category that is to be assigned.

    **Create a new category:**

    - Click <span class="btn">New Category</span>.

    - Enter the **Category Name** and choose the **Parent Category** to determine its position in the menu structure.

    - Click <span class="btn">Create Category</span>.

1. Choose the **Country of Manufacture**.

    _Bundle Details_

    There might be additional attributes that describe the product. The selection varies attribute set, and you can complete them later.

## Step 5: Add the Bundle Items

1. Scroll down to the Bundle Items section. Then, set **Ship Bundle Items** to one of the following:

    - `Separately`
    - `Together`

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-items.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Bundle Items_

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Option</span>, Then, do the following:

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-new-option.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Add Bundle Options_

    - Enter an **Option Title** to be used field label.

    - Set **Input Type** to one of the following:

        - `Drop-down`
        - `Radio buttons`
        - `Checkbox`
        - `Multiple Select`

    - To make the field a required entry, mark the **Required** checkbox.

    - Click <span class="btn">Add Products to Option</span>. Then, select the checkbox of each product that you want to include in this option. If there are many products, use the [list filters]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) and [pagination controls]({% link catalog/navigation-pagination.md %}) to find the products you need.

    - Click <span class="btn">Add Selected Products</span>.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-add-products-to-option.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Add Selected Products_

    - After the items appear in the Options section choose one to be the **Default** selection.

    - In the **Default Quantity** column, enter the quantity of each item that is to be added to the bundle when a customer chooses the item.

    - To allow customers to change the quantity of a bundle item, select the **User Defined** option.

    {:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
    The quantity can be a preset or user-defined value. However, do not assign the User Defined property to checkbox or multiple-select input types.

    By default, the Default Quantity that is included in a bundle item cannot be changed by the customer. However, the customer can enter the quantity of the item that is to be included in the bundle.

    For example, if the Default Quantity of the Sprite Status Ball is set to 2, and the customer orders 4 of that bundle option, the total number of total balls purchased is 8.

1. Repeat these steps for each item you want to add to the bundle.

    The order of items can also be changed in the data of an exported bundle product, and then reimported into the catalog. To learn more, see [Importing Bundle Products]({% link system/data-transfer-bundle-products.md %}).

1. To change the order of sections in a bundle product, click the **Move** ( ![Move icon]({% link images/images/btn-drag.png %}){: .Inline} ) icon in the header of the section and drag the section to the new position. To have a better view of the workspace, collapse each section first and then drag them into position.
