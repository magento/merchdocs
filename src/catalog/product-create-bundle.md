title: Bundle Product
---

A bundle is a _build your own_, customizable product. Each item in a bundle can be based on one of the following product types:

- [Simple Product]({% link catalog/product-create-simple.md %})
- [Virtual Product]({% link catalog/product-create-virtual.md %})

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Bundle Product_

The options appear when the customer clicks either **Customize** or **Add to Cart**. Because the products that are included in the bundle vary, the SKU, Price, and Weight can be set to either a dynamic or fixed value.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) is not available for Bundle products that use dynamic pricing.

If [Instant Purchase]({% link sales/checkout-instant-purchase.md %}) is available, the _Instant Purchase_ button appears below the _Add to Cart_ button for each item in the bundle.

_Customize Bundle_

The following instructions take you through the process of creating a bundle product using a [product template]({% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}), required fields, and basic settings. Each required field is marked with a red asterisk (`*`). When you finish the basics, you can complete the [advanced settings]({% link catalog/settings-advanced.md %}) and [other settings]({% link catalog/settings-other.md %}) as needed.

## Step 1: Choose the product type

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. In the upper-right corner on the _Add Product_ ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-save-menu.png %}){: width="25px"} ) menu, choose **Bundle Product**.

    ![]({% link images/images/21product-add-bundle.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Add Bundle Product_

## Step 2: Choose the attribute set

To choose the [attribute set]({% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}) that is used as a template for the product, do one of the following:

- For **Search**, enter the name of the attribute set,
- In the list, choose the attribute set that you want to use.

The form is updated to reflect the change.

_Choose Template_

## Step 3: Complete the required settings

1. Enter the product **Product Name**.

1. Either accept the default **SKU** that is based on the product name or enter a different value.

   To determine the type of SKU that is assigned to each bundle item, do the following:

   - A **Dynamic SKU** can be assigned automatically to each bundle item by adding a suffix to the default SKU. By default, this is set to `Yes`.

   - If you prefer to assign a unique SKU for each bundle item, set **Dynamic SKU** to `No`.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-dynamic-sku-price.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Dynamic SKU and Price_

1. To determine the price of the bundle, do one of the following:

   - To have the price reflect the options chosen by the customer, set **Dynamic Price** to `Yes` and leave **Price** blank.

   - To charge a fixed price for the bundle, set **Dynamic Price** to `No` and enter the **Price** that you want to charge for the bundle.

1. Because the product is not yet ready to publish, set **Enable Product** to `No`.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save</span> and continue.

    When the product is saved, the [Store View]({% link catalog/product-scope.md %}) chooser appears in the upper-left corner.

1. Choose the **Store View** where the product is to be available.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-create-store-view-choose.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Choose Store View_

## Step 4: Complete the basic settings

1. If the bundle has Fixed Pricing, set **Tax Class** to one of the following:

   - `None`
   - `Taxable Goods`

    If the bundle has Dynamic Pricing, the tax is determined for each bundle item.

1. Take note of the following:

   - The **Quantity** is not available because the value is determined for each bundle item.

   - By default, the **Stock Status** is set to `In Stock`.

1. To determine the weight of the bundle, do one of the following:

   - To have the weight reflect the options chosen by the customer, set **Dynamic Weight** set `Yes` and leave **Weight** blank.

   - To assign a fixed weight to the bundle, set **Dynamic Weight** to `No` and enter the **Weight** of the bundle.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-dynamic-weight.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Dynamic Weight_

1. To feature the product in the list of [new products]({% link cms/widget-new-products-list.md %}), select the **Set Product as New** checkbox.

   **Choose an existing category:**

    _Bundle Details_

    There might be additional attributes that describe the product. The selection varies attribute set, and you can complete them later.

## Step 5: Add the bundle items

1. Scroll down to the _Bundle Items_ section and set **Ship Bundle Items** to one of the following:

   - `Separately`
   - `Together`

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-items.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Bundle Items_

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Option</span> and do the following:

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-new-option.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Add Bundle Options_

   - Enter an **Option Title** to be used as the field label.

   - Set **Input Type** to one of the following:

      - `Drop-down`
      - `Radio buttons`
      - `Checkbox`
      - `Multiple Select`

   - To make the field a required entry, select the **Required** checkbox.

   - Click <span class="btn">Add Products to Option</span> and select the checkbox of each product that you want to include in this option.

      If there are many products, use the [list filters]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) and [pagination controls]({% link catalog/navigation-pagination.md %}) to find the products you need.

   - Click <span class="btn">Add Selected Products</span>.

      ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-add-products-to-option.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Add Selected Products_

   - After the items appear in the _Options_ section, choose an item to be the **Default** selection.

   - In the _Default Quantity_ column, enter the quantity of each item that is to be added to the bundle when a customer chooses the item.

   - To allow customers to change the quantity of a bundle item, select **User Defined**.

      {:.bs-callout-info}
      The quantity can be a preset or user-defined value. However, do not assign the _User Defined_ property to checkbox or multiple-select input types.

      By default, the Default Quantity that is included in a bundle item cannot be changed by the customer. However, the customer can enter the quantity of the item that is to be included in the bundle.

      For example, if the Default Quantity of the Sprite Status Ball is set to `2` and the customer orders `4` of that bundle option, the total number of total balls purchased is `8`.

      ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-item-detail.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Item Detail_

1. Repeat these steps for each item you want to add to the bundle.

1. To change the order of items in a bundle section, click the **Move** ( ![Move icon]({% link images/images/btn-drag.png %}) ) icon at the beginning of the row and drag the item into position.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-bundle-items-move.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Change the Order of Bundle Items_

    The order of items can also be changed in the data of an exported bundle product and then reimported into the catalog. For more information, see [Importing Bundle Products]({% link system/data-transfer-bundle-products.md %}).

1. To change the order of sections in a bundle product, click the **Move** ( ![Move icon]({% link images/images/btn-drag.png %}) ) icon in the header of the section and drag the section to the new position.

   To have a better view of the workspace, collapse each section first and then drag them into position.
