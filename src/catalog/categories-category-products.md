## To apply a category rule:

1. Set **Match products by rule** to the `Yes` position.

   The automatic sorting and condition options appear.

   _To Match Products by Rule_

   **Automatic Sort**

   To apply a sort order automatically to the list, based on current conditions, set **Automatic Sorting** to one of the following:

   | `Stock level` | Move to top or bottom. |
   | `Special price` | Move to top or bottom. |
   | `New Products` | List newest products first. |
   | `Color` | Sort alphabetically by color. |
   | `Name` | Sort in ascending or descending order by Name. |
   | `SKU` | Sort in ascending or descending order by SKU |
   | `Price` | Sort in ascending or descending order by Price. |

   **Add Condition**

   - Click <span class="btn">Add Condition</span> and do the following:

      - Choose the **Attribute** that is the basis of the condition.
      - Choose the **Operator** that is needed to form the expression.
      - Enter the **Value** that is to be matched.

      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images-ee/category-rule-create.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Add Condition to Category Rule_

   - Repeat this process for each attribute that is needed to describe the condition(s) to be met. For example, to match products that were created between 7 and 30 days ago, do the following:

      - Set **Date Created** to `Less than 30`.
      - Set **Logic** to `AND`.
      - Set **Date Modified** to `Greater than 7`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Category</span>.

When setting up a category rule, the products are matched and assigned to the rule when the category is saved. Therefore, if you add a new product to the catalog and want to include it in the rule, you must re-save each category that is set to match products by rule to ensure that the new product is included.
