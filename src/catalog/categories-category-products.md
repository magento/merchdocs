title: Products in Category
---

The Products in Category section lists the products that are currently assigned to the category. The search filters at the top of each column are used to add and remove products from the category. You can also use [category rules]({% link catalog/category-product-rules.md %}) (<span class="ee-only"></span>) to dynamically change the product selection when a set of conditions is met. To learn more, see [Visual Merchandiser]({% link marketing/visual-merchandiser.md %}).

   The automatic sorting and condition options appear.

   _To Match Products by Rule_

1. Set the **Automatic Sorting** order.

   This automatic sorting is based on current conditions.

   | `Stock level` | Move to top or bottom. |
   | `Special price` | Move to top or bottom. |
   | `New Products` | List newest products first. |
   | `Color` | Sort alphabetically by color. |
   | `Name` | Sort in ascending or descending order by Name. |
   | `SKU` | Sort in ascending or descending order by SKU |
   | `Price` | Sort in ascending or descending order by Price. |

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Condition</span> and do the following:

      - Choose the **Attribute** that is the basis of the condition.
      - Choose the **Operator** that is needed to form the expression.
      - Enter the **Value** that is to be matched.

      _Add Condition to Category Rule_

    Repeat this process for each attribute that is needed to describe the condition(s) to be met. For example, to match products that were created between 7 and 30 days ago, do the following:

      - Set **Date Created** to `Less than 30`.
      - Set **Logic** to `AND`.
      - Set **Date Modified** to `Greater than 7`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Category</span>.

{:.bs-callout-tip}
When setting up a category rule, the products are matched and assigned to the rule when the category is saved. Therefore, if you add a new product to the catalog and want to include it in the rule, you must re-save each category that is set to match products by rule to ensure that the new product is included.

The quantity of a configurable product with child options is calculated by combining all the salable child product quantities. For example, if you have a configurable product _Nona Fitness Tank_ with purple, red, and yellow color options and different quantities of each, the parent product (Nona Fitness Tank) quantity is the combined salable quantity of the purple, red, and yellow color child products.
