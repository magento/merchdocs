There are three kinds of gift card products:

- Virtual gift cards sent by email
- Physical gift cards that can be shipped to the recipient
- Combination of the Virtual and Physical

Each gift card has a unique code, which can be redeemed by only one customer during checkout. A [code pool]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-account-configuration.md %}) must be established before gift cards can be sold.

## Virtual

A [virtual gift card]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-workflow.md %}) is sent to the recipient's email address, which is required during the purchase of the gift card. A shipping address is not necessary.

## Physical

A [physical gift card]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-workflow.md %}) is shipped to recipient’s address, which is required during the purchase of the gift card.

## Combined

A [combined gift card]({% link catalog/product-gift-card-workflow.md %}) is shipped and emailed to the recipient. The recipient’s email and shipping address is required during the purchase of the gift card.
