When the same product is assigned to several categories with different design settings for each category, it is recommended to set **Use Categories Path for Product URLs** = `Yes` in the [Search Engine Optimization configuration options]({% link configuration/catalog/catalog.md %}#search-engine-optimization). To access this setting, go to  **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**, expand **Catalog** and choose **Catalog** underneath in the left panel, and then expand the **Search Engine Optimization** section on the page.
