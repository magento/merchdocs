title: Hidden Categories
---

There are many ways to use hidden categories. You might want to create additional category levels for your own internal purposes, but show only the higher-level categories to your customers. Or, you might want to link to a category that is not included in the navigation menu.

## Create hidden categories

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Categories**.

1. In the category tree, select the category you want to hide and do the following:

   - Set **Is Active** to `Yes`.
   - Set **Include in Menu** to `No`.

1. In the **Display Settings** section, set **Anchor** to `No`.

   ![]({% link catalog/assets/hidden-categories.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Hidden Category_

    The hidden category is active, but does not appear in the top menu, or in layered navigation.

1. Complete the following settings for each hidden subcategory to create subcategories:

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Although the category is hidden, you can create subcategories beneath it and make them active.

   - Set **Enable Category** to `Yes`.
   - In the **Display Settings** section, set **Anchor** to `Yes`.

    As active categories, you can now link to them from other places in your store, but they will not appear in the menu.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
