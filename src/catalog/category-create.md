title: Creating Categories

The category structure of your catalog is like an upside-down tree, with the root at the top. Each section of the tree can be expanded and collapsed. Any disabled or hidden categories are grayed out. The first level of categories below the [root]({% link catalog/category-root.md %}) typically appear as options in the [main menu]({% link catalog/navigation-top.md %}). You can create as many additional subcategories as needed, according to the maximum [menu depth]({% link catalog/navigation-top.md %}) that is set in the configuration. Categories can be dragged and dropped to other locations in the tree. The category ID number appears in parentheses after the category name at the top of the page.

For a website with multiple [stores]({% link stores/stores-all-create-store.md %}), you can create a different root category for each store that defines the set of categories that is used for the [top navigation]({% link catalog/navigation-top.md %}).

## Step 1: Create a category

{:.bs-callout-info}
<span class="ee-only"></span>Users with access restricted to a specific website are not able to see the Default Category, as well as the "Add Root Category" and "Add Subcategory" buttons. Restricted users are not able to create categories, assign products to categories, or do other _global_ actions that affect scopes beyond their allowed website. See [User Roles]({% link system/permissions-user-roles.md %}#step-2assign-resources) to read more about website-restricted access.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Categories**.

1. Set **Store View** to determine where the new category is to be available.

1. In the category tree, select the parent category of the new category.

   If you’re starting from the beginning without any data, there might be only two categories in the list: _Default Category_, which is the root, and an _Example category_

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Subcategory</span>.

## Step 2: Complete the basic information
