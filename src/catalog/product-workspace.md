title: Product Workspace
---

The product workspace is basically the same for all product types, although the selection of fields changes depending on the attribute set that is used. The product attributes are at the top of the form, followed by expandable sections of product information. When a new product is saved for the first time, the Store View chooser appears at the upper-left of the form.

## Enable Product setting

The online status of the product is indicated by the switch at the top of the form. To change the online status, set the **Enable Product** switch to `Yes` or `No`.

| Control | Description |
|----------
| ![]({% link images/images/btn-switch-yes.png %}) | Indicates that the product is currently online. |
| ![]({% link images/images/btn-switch-no.png %}) | Indicates that the product is currently offline. |

## Attribute set

The name of the [attribute set]({% link stores/attribute-sets.md %}) appears in the upper-left corner and determines the fields that appear in the product record. To choose a different attribute set, click the down arrow next to the default attribute set name.
