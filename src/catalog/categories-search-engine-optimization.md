title: Search Engine Optimization
---

The Search Engine Optimization section specifies the [URL Key]({% link catalog/catalog-urls.md %}) and [meta data]({% link marketing/meta-data.md %}) fields that are used by search engines to index the category. Although some search engines ignore meta keywords, others continue to use them. The current [SEO best practice]({% link marketing/seo-best-practices.md %}) is to incorporate high-value keywords in both the meta title and meta description.

|URL Key|Store View| Determines the online address of the category page. The URL key is added to the base URL of the store, and appears in the address bar of a browser. In the configuration, you can either include or exclude the category URL key in the product URL. The URL Key should be all lowercase characters, with non-trailing hyphens between these characters instead of spaces. Do not include a suffix such as .html, because it is managed in the configuration. |
|Meta Title|Store View| The title appears in the title bar and tab of your browser, and is also the title on a search engine results page (SERP). The meta title should be unique to the page and less than 70 characters in length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|Meta Keywords|Store View| Relevant keywords for the category. Consider using keywords that customers might use to find products in the category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|Meta Description|Store View| The meta description provides a brief overview of the page for search results listings. An ideal length is between 150-160 characters in length, with a maximum of 255 characters. Although not visible to the customer, some search engines include the meta description on the search results page.                                                                                                                                                         |
