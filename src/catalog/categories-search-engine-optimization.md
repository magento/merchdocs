title: Search Engine Optimization
---

The Search Engine Optimization section specifies the [URL Key]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link catalog/catalog-urls.md %}) and [meta data]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/meta-data.md %}) fields that are used by search engines to index the category. Although some search engines ignore meta keywords, others continue to use them. The current [SEO best practice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/seo-best-practices.md %}) is to incorporate high-value keywords in both the meta title and meta description.
