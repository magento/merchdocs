title: Adding Product Video
---

To add product video, you must first obtain an API Key from your Google account and enter it in the configuration of your store. Then, you can link to the video from the product.

## Step 1: Get your YouTube API key

1. Log in to your Google account and visit the [Google Developers Console][1].

1. In the Search field at the top, enter `YouTube Data API v3` and click the search icon.

1. When the API page is displayed, make sure it is enabled.

1. In the left panel, choose **Credentials**.

1. Depending on whether you have credentials or not, do one of the following:

   - If you already have the needed credentials, copy the key in the _API keys_ table.

   - If you do not already have credentials for this API, click <span class="btn">Create Credentials</span>  at the top and follow the prompts to create the needed credentials. Under _Get your credentials_, copy the API key and click <span class="btn">Done</span>.

1. Copy the API key to the clipboard.

1. Click the Edit icon on the right and set the restrictions to make sure the API key is limited to the correct referrers.

1. Wait a few moments while the key is generated and then copy the key to the clipboard.

    In the next step, you will paste the key into your store’s configuration.

## Step 2: Configure the key in Magento

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Catalog** and choose **Catalog** underneath.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the _Product Video_ section and paste your **YouTube API key**.

    ![]({% link images/images/config-catalog-catalog-product-video.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Product Video_

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

1. When prompted, refresh the cache.

## Step 3: Link to the video

1. Open a product in edit mode.

1. In the _Images and Video_ section, click <span class="btn">Add Video</span>.

    If you haven’t yet configured your YouTube API key, click <span class="btn">OK</span> to continue. You won’t be able to link to a YouTube video, but you can go through the process.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-video-add.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Add Video_

1. Enter the **URL** of the YouTube or Vimeo video.

1. Click outside the field and wait for feedback on the API key or video.

   If everything checks out, Youtube provides base information of the video

1. Enter the **Title** and **Description** of the video.

1. To upload a **Preview Image**, browse to the image and select the file.

1. If you prefer to use the video meta data, click <span class="btn">Get Video Information</span>.

1. To determine how the video is used in the store, select the checkbox of each **Role** that applies:

   - `Base Image`
   - `Small Image`
   - `Swatch Image`
   - `Thumbnail`
   - `Hide from Product Page`

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
