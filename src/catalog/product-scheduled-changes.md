Product updates can be applied on schedule and grouped with other content changes. You can use [content staging]({% link cms/content-staging.md %}) to create a new campaign based on scheduled changes to the product, or apply the changes to an existing campaign.

{:.bs-callout-info}
All scheduled updates are applied consecutively. This means that any entity can have only one scheduled update at one point of time. Any scheduled update is applied to all store views within its time frame. As a result, an entity cannot have different scheduled updates for different store views at the same time. All entity attribute values within all store views, which are not affected by the current scheduled update, are taken from the default values, and not from the previous scheduled update.
