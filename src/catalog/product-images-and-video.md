From the Images and Videos section, you can perform basic image management tasks such as upload multiple images, rearrange the order of images, and control how each image is used. For additional control over individual images you can open each image in _detail view_. To learn more, see [Catalog Images and Video]({% link catalog/catalog-images-video.md %}).

    - Drag an image from your desktop, and drop it on the **camera** (![]({% link images/images/btn-camera.png %})) tile.

    - Click the **camera** (![]({% link images/images/btn-camera.png %})) tile, select the image file, and click <span class="btn">Open</span>.
