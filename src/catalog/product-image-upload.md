For each product, you can upload multiple images, rearrange their order images, and control how each image is used. If you have a large quantity of images to manage, you may prefer to import them as a batch, rather than upload each one individually. For more information, see [Importing Product Images]({% link system/data-import-product-images.md %}).

If you plan to upload large images for viewing on the _Product Details_ page, you may want to consider setting a maximum pixel size (width and height) and automatically resize the files prior to upload. We provide an option to enable automatic resizing of larger image files as you upload. For more information, see [Resizing Product Images]({% link catalog/product-image-resizing.md %}).

## Manage images

1. Open the product in edit mode.

1. To work with a specific store view, set the **Store View** chooser in the upper-left corner to the applicable view.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   New product images are **_always_** uploaded and visible in **_all_** store views, even if the `All Store Views` scope is not used for upload. <br/><br/>To hide any product image from a specific store view, you must switch to that Store View , select the **Hide from Product Page** checkbox for the image, and click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

1. Scroll down and expand the _Images and Videos_ section.

### Upload an image

For the best compatibility, it is recommended to upload all product images with the `sRGB` color profile. All other color profiles are automatically converted to the `sRGB` color profile during the product image upload, which could cause color inconsistency in the uploaded image.

The image file name length, including extension, cannot exceed 90 characters.

To upload an image, do one of the following:

- Drag an image from your desktop and drop it on the **camera** ( ![]({% link assets/icon-camera.png %})) tile in the _Images_ box.

- In the _Images_ box, click the **camera** ( ![]({% link assets/icon-camera.png %}){: .Inline}) tile, select the image file on your computer, and click <span class="btn">Open</span>.

    ![]({% link catalog/assets/product-images-and-video-jewel-tee.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Upload or Drag and Drop_

### Rearrange images

To change the order of images in the gallery, click the **Sort** ( ![]({% link catalog/assets/inventory-icon-sort.png %}) ) icon at the bottom of the image tile and  drag the image to a different position in the _Images_ box.

![]({% link catalog/assets/product-images-and-videos-drag.png %}){: .zoom}
_Change Order_

### Delete an image

To remove an image from the gallery, click the **Delete** ( ![]({% link assets/icon-delete-trashcan.png %}) ) icon in the upper-right corner of the image tile and click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

### Set image details

Click the image that you want to open in detail view and do any of the following:

   ![]({% link catalog/assets/product-image-detail-jewel-tee.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Image Detail View_

  To close detail view, click **Close** ( ![]({% link assets/icon-close-x.png %}) ) in the upper-right corner.

When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

#### Enter alt text

Image Alt text is referenced by screen readers to improve web accessibility and by search engines when indexing the site. Some browsers display the Alt text on mouseover. Alt text can be several words long and include carefully selected key words.

In the _Alt Text_ box, enter a brief description of the image.

#### Assign roles

By default, all roles are assigned to the first image that is uploaded to the product. To reassign a role to another image, do the following:

In the _Role_ box, choose the role that you want to assign to the image.

When you return to the _Images and Videos_ section, the currently assigned roles appear below each image.
