   _Catalog Details_

1. Update the catalog detail information as needed.

   - Changing the name of a shared catalog, also changes the name of the corresponding customer group.
   - Changing the catalog type from `Custom` to `Public` converts the existing public catalog to a custom catalog. Any companies associated with the original public catalog are reassigned to the replacement. A public catalog cannot be converted to a custom catalog.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
