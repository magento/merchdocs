title: Product Types
---

Magento supports multiple product types within the catalog.

|Simple product|A [simple product]({% link catalog/product-create-simple.md %}) is a physical item with a single SKU. Simple products have a variety of pricing and of input controls which makes it possible to sell variations of the product. Simple products can be used in association with grouped, bundle, and configurable products.|
|Configurable product|A [configurable product]({% link catalog/product-create-configurable.md %}) appears to be a single product with lists of options for each variation. However, each option represents a separate, simple product with a distinct SKU, which makes it possible to track inventory for each variation.|
|Grouped product|A [grouped product]({% link catalog/product-create-grouped.md %}) presents multiple, standalone products as a group. You can offer variations of a single product, or group them for a promotion. The products can be purchased separately or as a group.|
|Virtual product|[Virtual products]({% link catalog/product-create-virtual.md %}) are not tangible products, and are typically used for products such as services, memberships, warranties, and subscriptions. Virtual products can be used in association with grouped and bundle products.|
|Bundle product|A [bundle product]({% link catalog/product-create-bundle.md %}) lets customers “build their own” from an assortment of options. The bundle could be a gift basket, computer, or anything else that can be customized. Each item in the bundle is a separate, standalone product.|
|Downloadable product|A digitally [downloadable product]({% link catalog/product-create-downloadable.md %}) consists of one or more files that are downloaded. The files can reside on your server or be provided as URLs to any other server.|<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
|Gift card|There are three kinds of [gift cards]({% link catalog/product-gift-card.md %}): virtual gift cards that are sent by email, physical gift cards that are shipped to the recipient, and combined gift cards that are a combination of the two. Each has a unique code, which is redeemed during checkout. Gift cards can also be included in a grouped product.|<!--{% endif %}-->
