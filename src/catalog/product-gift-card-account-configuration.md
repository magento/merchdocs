title: Configuring Gift Card Accounts
---

The Gift Card configuration establishes the default settings for all gift cards for the store view and manages the code pool. The code pool is a set of unique gift card codes in a specific format. Codes from the pool are used each time a gift card account is created. It is the responsibility of the store administrator to ensure that there are enough codes available for gift card sales. Make sure to generate a code pool before offering gift cards for sale. By default, Adobe Commerce generates 1,000 codes. A new code pool is not generated until there are no more codes available in the current pool.

## Step 1: Configure email notifications

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Gift Cards**.

1. Expand ![]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the _Gift Card Email Settings_ section and do the following:

   - Set **Gift Card Notification Email Sender** to the store identity that appears as the sender of gift card notifications.

   - Set **Gift Card Notification Email Template** to the template that is used for the notification.

    Depending on your location, it may be illegal for gift cards to expire. Check your local laws before setting a lifetime for your gift cards.

1. If you want the customer to have the option to enter a message to accompany the gift card, set **Allow Gift Message** to `Yes` and enter the number of characters available for the message for **Gift Message Maximum Length**.

1. Set **Generate Gift Card Account when Orders Item is** to one of the following:

    |Ordered|The gift card account is created when the order is placed. |
    |Invoiced|The gift card account is created after payment is captured and the order is invoiced. |
