title: Configure Global Options
---

Configure the default configuration options for product and stock for your websites. Some of these settings can be overridden per product through [Configuring Product Options]({% link catalog/inventory-product-stock-options.md %}). To configure Distance Priority settings, see [Configuring Distance Priority Algorithm]({% link catalog/inventory-configure-distance-priority.md %}).

## Configure product and stock options globally

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Catalog** and choose **Inventory**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %})the **Stock Options** section and set the options:

    - To adjust the quantity on hand when an order is placed, set **Decrease Stock When Order is Placed** to `Yes`.

    - To return items to stock if an order is canceled, **Set Items’ Status to be in Stock When Order in Cancelled** to `Yes`.

    - To continue to display products in the catalog that are no longer in stock, set **Display Out of Stock Products** to `Yes`.

    - If [price alerts]({% link catalog/inventory-product-alerts.md %}) are enabled, customers can sign up to be notified when the product is back in stock.

    - To set the start for displaying the last remaining inventory amount on the product page, enter an amount for **Only X left Threshold**.

        The message begins to appear when the quantity in stock reaches the threshold. For example, if set to `3`, the message “Only 3 left” appears when the quantity in stock reaches three. The message adjusts to reflect the quantity in stock, until the quantity reaches zero.

    - To display an “In Stock” or “Out of Stock” message on the product page, set **Display Products Availability In Stock on Storefront** to `Yes`.

    - To keep consistency between inventory and catalog, set **Synchronize with Catalog** to `Yes`. With this option enabled, inventory data will be adjusted according to the catalog changes (such as product removed, product SKU changed, and product type changed).

       ![]({% link images/images/config-catalog-catalog-inventory-stock-options.png %}){: .zoom}
       [_Stock Options_]({% link configuration/catalog/inventory.md %})

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %})the **Product Stock Options** section and set the options:

    - To activate [inventory control]({% link catalog/inventory.md %}) for your catalog, set **Manage Stock** to `Yes`.

       ![]({% link images/images/config-catalog-catalog-inventory-product-stock-options.png %}){: .zoom}
       [_Product Stock Options_]({% link configuration/catalog/inventory.md %})

    - Set **[Backorders]({% link catalog/inventory-backorders.md %})** to one of the following:

       | No Backorders | To not accept backorders when product is out of stock. |
       | Allow Qty Below 0 | To accept backorders when the quantity falls below zero. |
       | Allow Qty Below 0 and Notify Customer | To accept backorders when the quantity falls below zero, and notify the customer that the order can still be placed. |

    - Enter the **Maximum Qty Allowed in Shopping Cart**.

    - Enter an amount for the **Out-of-Stock Threshold**:

       | Positive amount | With Backorders disabled, enter a positive amount. |
       | Zero | With Backorders enabled, entering zero allows for infinite backorders. |
       | Negative amount | With Backorders enabled, we recommend entering a negative amount. The amount is added to the Salable Quantity. For example, enter -50 to allow orders up to this amount. |

    - Enter the **Minimum Qty Allowed in Shopping Cart** for selected group and amounts.

    - In the **Notify for Quantity Below** field, enter the stock level that triggers notification that the item is out of stock.

    - To activate quantity increments for the product, set **Enable Qty Increments** to `Yes`. Then in the **Qty Increments** field, enter the number of the items that must be purchased to meet the requirement.

        For example, an item that is sold in increments of 6 can be purchased in quantities of 6, 12, 18, and so on.

    - For Inventory Management, **Automatically Return Credit Memo Item to Stock** is set to `No`. When submitting a credit memo, you enter and select to return stock to sources.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Admin bulk operations** section.

    - Set **Run asynchronously** to run bulk operations asynchronously for mass product actions

      This includes bulk [assign sources]({% link catalog/inventory-bulk-assign-sources.md %}), [unassign sources]({% link catalog/inventory-bulk-unassign-sources.md %}), and [transfer inventory to source]({% link catalog/inventory-bulk-transfer-inventory.md %}). It collects bulk actions up to the Asynchronous batch size, then runs those actions. This option is disabled by default. We recommend reviewing your performance with bulk actions before enabling.

        {% include inventory-async-queues.md %}

    - If enabled, set the **Asynchronous batch size**. The default batch size is 100. When bulk processes reach this amount, they perform them at that time.
