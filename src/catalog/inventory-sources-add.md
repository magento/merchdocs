title: Adding a New Source
---

Manage inventory and order fulfillment from multiple locations with custom sources. Create a source for each location such as warehouses, brick-and-mortar stores, distribution centers, and drop shippers. Assign sources and update quantities per product

If editing the Default Source, you can edit all configurations except name and code. We recommend single source merchants add information matching their location.
