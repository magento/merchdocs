Customers can subscribe to two types of alerts by email - price change alerts and in-stock alerts. For each type of alert, you can determine if customers are able to subscribe, select the email template that is used and identify the sender of the email.

_Sign Up for Price Alert_

## Price change alerts

When price change alerts are enabled, a _Sign up for price alert_ link appears on every product page. Customers can click the link to subscribe to alerts related to the product. Guests are prompted to open an account with your store. Whenever the price changes or the product goes on special, everyone who has signed up to be notified receives an email alert.

## In-Stock alerts

The in-stock alert creates a link called _Sign up to get notified when this product is back in stock_ for every product that is out of stock. Customers can click the link to subscribe to the alert. When the product is back in stock, customers receive email notification that the product is available. Products with alerts have a _Product Alerts_ tab in the Product Information panel that lists the customers who have subscribed to an alert.
