title: Schedule Design Update
---

The Schedule Design Update section gives you the ability to make temporary changes to the appearance of the product page. You can schedule design changes for a season, promotion, or just to mix things up. Design changes can be scheduled in advance, so they go into effect, or _drip_, on your defined schedule.
