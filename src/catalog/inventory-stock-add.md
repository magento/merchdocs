title: Adding a New Stock
---


Stocks map your sources to sales channels (or websites), providing a direct link to salable quantities and product inventories.

When creating a custom stock, you assign websites and sources. Sources can include enabled and disabled sources. For example, you may add a new warehouse to your stock, preparing to open the location for managing inventory and completing shipments.

After adding sources, you need to prioritize the order for the sources from top (first) to bottom (last). This order affects recommendations during order shipment.
