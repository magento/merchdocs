[Live Search]({% link live-search/overview.md %}) is an advanced search service that is available for Adobe Commerce. The standard search functionality described in this topic does not apply to Live Search.

Advanced Search lets shoppers search the catalog based on values entered into a form. Because the form contains multiple fields, a single search can include several parameters. The result is a list of all products in the catalog that match the criteria. A link to Advanced Search is in the footer of your store.

_Advanced Search_

Each field in the form corresponds to an attribute from your product catalog. To add a field, set the frontend properties of the attribute to `Include in Advanced Search`. As a best practice, include only the fields that customers are most likely to use to find a product, because having too many will slow down the search.

1. In the footer of the store, click **Advanced Search**.

1. In the _Advanced Search_ form, add full or partial values in as many fields as necessary.

1. Click <span class="btn">Search</span> to display the results.
