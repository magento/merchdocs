Choosing a product type is one of the first things you must do to create a new product. The following demonstrates how to create a product of each type. In addition to the basic product types, the term _complex product_ is sometimes used to refer to products with multiple options, such as a configurable product that is available in various colors and sizes. For more information about the available options, see [Product Settings]({% link catalog/settings.md %}) and [Advanced Settings]({% link catalog/settings-advanced.md %}).

If you are just beginning, you can create a few sample products to experiment with each product type. For a deeper understanding, refer to catalog [navigation]({% link catalog/navigation.md %}), how to set up [categories]({% link catalog/categories.md %}) and [attributes]({% link stores/attributes-product.md %}), and the catalog [URL options]({% link catalog/catalog-urls.md %}) that are available.

After you understand the basics, the most efficient way to add a large number of products to the catalog is to [import]({% link system/data-import.md %}) them from a CSV file.
