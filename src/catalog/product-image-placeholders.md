Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source use temporary images as placeholders until the permanent product images become available. A different placeholder can be uploaded for each role. The initial placeholder image is a sample logo, which you can replace with the image of your choice.

_Image Placeholder_

## Upload placeholder images

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Catalog** and choose **Catalog** underneath.

1. Expand ![Expansion icon]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the _Product Image Placeholders_ section.

1. For each image role, click <span class="btn">Choose File</span>, find the image on your computer, and upload the file.

   You can use the same image for all three roles, or you can upload a different placeholder image for each role.

    ![]({% link configuration/catalog/assets/catalog-product-image-placeholders.png %}){: .zoom}
    [_Product Image Placeholders_]({% link configuration/catalog/catalog.md %})

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
