Cross-sell items are similar to impulse purchases positioned next to the cash register in the checkout line. Products offered as a cross-sell appear on the shopping cart page, just before the customer begins the checkout process.

To show or hide cross-sell items per store view, see the [Checkout > Shopping Cart]({% link configuration/sales/checkout.md %}) option called _Show Cross-sell Items_ in the Shopping Cart. You may want to hide cross-sells during specific sales or for A/B testing in a store view.
