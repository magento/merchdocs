To assign a special price to multiple products, such as multiple variations of a [configurable product]({% link catalog/product-create-configurable.md %}), use the [Actions control]({% link stores/admin-actions-control.md %}) as described in Method 2.

## Method 1: Apply Special Price to an Individual Product

1. Open the product in edit mode.
<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->

1. Click <span class="btn">Scheduled Update</span> and do the following:

    * In the **Update Name** field, enter a name for the special price promotion.

    * Enter a brief **Description**.

    * Use the **Calendar** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}){: .Inline} ) to choose the **Start Date** and **End Date** for the special price promotion. Use the **Hour** and **Minute** sliders to choose the start and end time, as well. Then, tap <span class="btn">Close</span>.

      ![]({% link images/images-ee/product-price-special-scheduled-update.png %}){: .zoom}
      *Save as New Update*

    * Scroll down to the **Price** field, and click **Advanced Pricing**. Then, enter the amount of the **Special Price**.

      *Special Pricing Settings*

1. When complete, click <span class="btn"> Done </span>. Then, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

## Method 2: Apply Special Price to Multiple Products

The following example shows how to assign the same special price to multiple product variations of a configurable product.

1. On the Admin sidebar, click **Catalog**. Then, choose **Products**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Filters</span>. Then, do the following:

    * Enter the **Name** of the configurable product.

    * Set **Type** to “Simple Product.”

    ![]({% link images/images/product-price-special-filter.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Filters*

    * Click <span class="btn">Apply Filters</span>.

    The grid lists all simple products that are associated as variations of the configurable product.

    ![]({% link images/images/product-price-special-filter-grid.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Product Variations*

1. If you want to assign the same special price to all of the products, set the control in the header of the first column to “Select All.” Otherwise, mark the checkbox of each product that you want to include.

1. Set the **Actions** control to “Update attributes.”

    ![]({% link images/images/product-price-special-action-update-attributes.png %}){: .zoom}
    *Update Attributes*

1. Scroll down to the **Special Price** field. Then, do the following:

    * Mark the **Change** checkbox below the **Special Price** field. Then, enter the special price that you want to offer.

    * Mark the **Change** checkbox below the **Special Price From Date** field. Click the **Calendar** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}){: .Inline} ), and choose the first date of the special price promotion.

        The special price goes into effect immediately after midnight at the beginning of the start date (00:01), and continues until just before midnight (23:59) on the day before the end date.

    * Mark the **Change** checkbox below the **Special Price To Date** field. Click the **Calendar** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}){: .Inline} ), and choose the last date of the special price promotion.

    *Special Price Fields*

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

    A message indicates how many records were updated with the special price.

    The special price becomes available in the store on the date specified, and appears in catalog listings as well as on the product page. For a configurable product, the regular price also appears on the product page when the options are chosen.
