## Apply a special price to multiple products

To assign a special price to multiple products, such as multiple variations of a [configurable product]({% link catalog/product-create-configurable.md %}), use the [Actions control]({% link stores/admin-actions-control.md %}).

The following example shows how to assign the same special price to multiple product variations of a configurable product.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Filters</span>.

1. Enter the **Name** of the configurable product.

1. Set **Type** to `Simple Product`.

    _Filters_

1. Click <span class="btn">Apply Filters</span>.

    The grid lists all simple products that are associated as variations of the configurable product.

    _Product Variations_

1. If you want to assign the same special price to all of the products, set the control in the header of the first column to `Select All`.

   As an alternative, you can select the checkbox of each product that you want to include.

1. Set the **Actions** control to `Update attributes`.

        The special price goes into effect immediately after midnight at the beginning of the start date (00:01) and continues until just before midnight (23:59) on the day before the end date.

    - Select the **Change** checkbox below the _Special Price To Date_ field, click the **Calendar** ( ![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %}) ), and choose the last date of the special price promotion.

    A message indicates how many records were updated with the special price.
