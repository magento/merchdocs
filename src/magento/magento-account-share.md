title: Sharing Your Account
group: getting-started

Your Magento account contains information that can be useful to trusted employees and service providers who help to manage your site. As the primary account holder, you have authority to grant limited access to your account to other Magento account holders. When your account is shared, all sensitive information—such as your billing history or credit card information—remains protected. It is not shared at any time with other users.

All actions taken by users with shared access to your account are your sole responsibility. Magento Inc. is not responsible for any actions taken by users to whom you grant shared account access.

## To set up a shared account:

1. Before you begin, get the following information from the Magento account of the **new user**:

   - Account ID located in the upper-left corner of the Magento tab, just above the **Log Out** link.
   - Email address associated with the account.

1. Log in to your [Magento account]({% link magento/magento-account.md %}).

1. In the panel on the left, under **Shared Access**, choose **Add New User**. Then, do the following:

   - Enter the **Acct ID** from the Magento account of the new user.
   - Enter the **Email** address that is associated with the Magento account of the new user.

1. In the **Shared Information** section, do the following:

   - Enter a **Sharename** to identify your shared account. Because the Sharename becomes an option in the Switch Accounts list, it should be something that the other person will recognize as your account.

   - To share your personal contact information, mark the checkbox of each item that you want to make available to the other person:

     - Your Email
     - Your Phone

1. In the **Grant Account Permissions** section, mark the checkbox of each Magento product and service that you want to share.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn"> Create Shared Access </span>.

    You are notified when the new role is saved, and the new user record appears in the Manage Permissions section of the Shared Access page. Magento also sends an email invitation to the new user with instructions to access the shared account.

## To access a shared account:

1. When you receive the invitation to a shared account, log in to your own Magento account.

    Your account dashboard has a new Switch Accounts control in the upper-right corner, with options for “My Account” and the name of the shared account.

1. To gain access to the shared account, set **Switch Accounts** to the name of the shared account.

    The shared account displays a welcome message and contact information. The left panel includes only the items that you have permission to use.
