Your Commerce account contains information that you can make available to trusted employees and service providers who help manage your site. As the primary account holder, you have authority to grant limited access to other Commerce account holders. Shared access can be revoked, but cannot be transferred from one user to another.

The Commerce Support team does not have access to the account and cannot set up shared access for you. Only the primary account holder with appropriate permissions can set up shared access. When your account is shared, all sensitive information &#8212; such as your billing history or credit card information &#8212; remains protected and is not shared at any time with other users.

All actions taken by users with shared access are the sole responsibility of the primary account holder. Adobe is not responsible for any actions taken by users who have shared access to your account.

## Access a shared account

The following instructions are written from the perspective of a shared user who receives an invitation to a shared account.

   The left panel of your account has a new _Shared with me_ tab. The _Switch Accounts_ control in the upper-right corner has options for `My Account` and the name of the shared account.

   _Support_

   You can use the [Adobe Commerce Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us) from the shared account to search for articles and troubleshooting information, find patches for known issues, and create support tickets.

   After receiving shared access, the user needs to log in to their [Commerce account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login), navigate to _Shared Access_, and click the **Support** tab. This needs to be done the first time only, in order to ensure that the [Commerce Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us) is configured properly through the `SSO` call.

1. In the left panel, click **Shared Access**.
