Your Magento account contains information that you can make available to trusted employees and service providers who help manage your site. As the primary account holder, you have authority to grant limited access to other Magento account holders. When your account is shared, all sensitive information &#8212; such as your billing history or credit card information &#8212; remains protected and is not shared at any time with other users.

All actions taken by users with shared access to your account are your sole responsibility. Adobe is not responsible for any actions taken by users to whom you grant shared account access.
