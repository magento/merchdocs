## Install Extensions

Installing an extension is a three-step process that should take place during off-peak hours. Before the extension is installed, your store is put into maintenance mode, checked for readiness, and backed up. After the extension is installed, it must be configured for your store according to the developer’s instructions.

For step-by-step installation instructions, see [Marketplace User Guide][4]{: target="_blank"}.
