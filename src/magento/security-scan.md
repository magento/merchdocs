Magento Security Scan allows you to monitor each of your Magento sites for known security risks, and to receive patch updates and security notifications.

- Gain insight into the real-time security status of your store.
- Schedule security scan to run weekly, daily, or on demand.
- Receive reports with the results of over thirty security tests and the recommended corrective actions for each failed test.
- Maintain a history of security reports in your Magento account.

The Security Scan tool is available for free from the dashboard of your Magento account. For technical information, see [Go live and launch][1] in our developer documentation.
