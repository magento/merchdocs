As a best practice, an extension should be installed and tested in a development environment before it is pushed to production. For detailed information about installing an extension, see [General CLI installation][3] in the Magento Extensions Guide. This might require the assistance of a system integrator, developer, or IT resource to complete the process.

Magento installations hosted on [Commerce Cloud][1] require an extension to be installed in a Magento development environment where the integration can be tested and deployed to a staging environment before being pushed to production. To learn more, see [Install, manage, and upgrade extensions][2] in the Magento Commerce Cloud Guide.
