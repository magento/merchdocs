title: Install an Extension
group: getting-started

Installing an extension from the Admin is a three-step process that should take place during off-peak hours. Before the extension is installed, your store is put into maintenance mode, checked for readiness, and backed up. After the extension is installed, it must be configured for your store according to the developer’s instructions.

## Simple installations

For step-by-step installation instructions from the Admin, see [Extension Manager]({% link system/web-setup-extension-manager.md %}).

## Advanced installations

Advanced installations might require the assistance of a system integrator, developer, or IT department to complete the process.

- Some extensions have an installation process that must be completed from the command line of your server.

- Magento installations hosted on Adobe Commerce Cloud have a more complex installation process that requires a Magento development environment where the integration is tested and deployed to a staging environment before being pushed to production.

To learn more, see [Install, manage, and upgrade extensions][1].
