## Inventory Management

Magento [Inventory Management]({% link catalog/inventory-management.md %}) provides enhanced stock and shipment management  across one or multiple locations and sales channels with concurrent checkout protection and shipment matching algorithms.  Track your inventory quantities, provide accurate salable stock amounts to customers, and ship according to recommendations or manual selections to control your entire inventory. Configure management settings globally, per source, and per product.
