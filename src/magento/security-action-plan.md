If you suspect that your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source site is compromised, follow this action plan without delay.

1. **Diagnose**

    Run a scan to establish the security status of your Commerce store. Commerce [Security Scan]({% link magento/security-scan.md %}) is a free service offered by Adobe that allows you to monitor your Commerce sites for known security risks and malware, and to receive security notifications.

1. **Clean**

    Hire a [qualified consultant](https://magento.com/partners/portal/directory?partner_type=1) or online service to clean your site of all malicious code. Some Commerce community members recommend [Sucuri Website Malware Removal](https://sucuri.net/website-antivirus/malware-removal). Check the `/media` folder for leftover executable code. Remove all unknown Admin users and reset all Admin passwords.

1. **Protect**

    Keep your Commerce installation up to date with the most current release. If you are using an older version, apply all security patches as they become available. Review and follow [Commerce Security Best Practices](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/security/pdfs/Adobe-Magento-Commerce-Best-Practices-Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Subscribe to [Commerce Security Alerts](https://magento.com/security/sign-up).

1. **Report**

    If you think that you have found a specific vulnerability in Commerce, send a description of the problem with technical details to [security@magento.com](mailto:security@magento.com?subject=Possible Commerce Vulnerability).

1. **Upgrade**

    For the additional peace of mind that comes from 24/7 support, plan your upgrade to [Adobe Commerce on our Cloud Architecture](https://magento.com/products/magento-commerce/cloud-delivery) now.
