As a best practice, we recommend that you keep your Magento installation up to date, so you can benefit from the latest advancements. Release notes provide a detailed description of the changes in each product release, with links to additional technical information, installation instructions, and support resources. To learn more about the current releases, see:

## Earlier releases

If you need documentation for an earlier Magento minor release, the following resources are available.

### 2.3

We continue to publish the [Magento 2.3 User Guide][21]. You can use the version switcher at the top of this page to change the current page to the 2.3 version (unless the page is targeted for a new feature in 2.4).

<div class="bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
**PDF guides**<br/>
Starting with our 2.3.2 release, we are no longer producing and publishing an updated 2.3 User Guide PDF to match our online content. This makes it possible for us to provide an improved online User Guide experience and publish content updates more frequently. You can download these archived guides from our site:

- {:.ce-only}[Magento Open Source 2.3.1 PDF guide][20]{:target="_blank"}
- {:.ee-only}[Magento Commerce 2.3.1 PDF guide][18]{:target="_blank"}
