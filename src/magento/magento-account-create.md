Anyone can open a free Commerce account from our website. The email address that is used to open an account can be associated with only one account, and the screen name that you enter becomes your identity in the forums.

## Link your Commerce account

You can link your Commerce account to your Adobe ID for single sign-on across all Adobe Commerce products and simpler user account management. When your Commerce accounts are linked to an Adobe ID in the Commerce Identity Manager and you are logged into that Adobe ID, you bypass the standard Commerce product login process and do not need to log in again. See [Setup Commerce Identity Manager]({% link magento/magento-identity-manager.md %}).
