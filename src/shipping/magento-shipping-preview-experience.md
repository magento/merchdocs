Preview Experience allows you to preview the shipping methods that display for a customer during checkout for a defined shopping basket. Experiences that do not display a shipping method are also identified. This helps you test your shipping experiences without having to navigate back and forth between your Magento site and the Magento Shipping Portal.

Preview Experience:

- Allows you to preview and test shipping experiences against a mock scenario from within the the Magento Shipping Portal.

- Allows you to create a custom persona that represents a real customer.

- Enables you to safely test shipping experiences against the custom persona.
