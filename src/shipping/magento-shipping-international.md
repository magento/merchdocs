{% include shipping-status-note.md %}

International item/shipment data can be pre-filled for a customer at checkout, if the information is defined for the products in the order. Pre-filled data requires configuration in Magento [Attribute Mapping]({% link shipping/magento-shipping-attributes.md %}) and defining the [shipping settings]({% link catalog/product-shipping.md %}) for each Magento product.

International item/shipment settings are defined for a product in the [Shipping]({% link catalog/product-shipping.md %}) tab in Product Settings.

International settings include:

- **Country of Origin** - The country from which the item will be shipped.

- **HS Code** - The Harmonized System is an international classification of products. It allows participating countries to classify traded goods on a common basis for customs purposes. At the international level, the [Harmonized System (HS)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/50018/Harmonized-Commodity-Description-and-Coding-Systems-HS) for classifying goods is a six-digit code system.
