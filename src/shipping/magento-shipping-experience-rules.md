{% include shipping-status-note.md %}

The following instructions describe how to create a **Qualify Rule**; however, the process is essentially the same for all shipping experience rules. You will describe the condition, choose an operator, and define the action to be taken. Follow these basic instructions to create any type of rule. Refer to the Field Descriptions table at the end of this topic for more information about different rule types and options.

## To Create a Shipping Experience Rule

1.  In the _Admin_ sidebar, choose **Stores**.

1.  In the _Shipping_ section, choose **Experiences**. The Magento Shipping Portal opens in a new tab.

1.  Click **Create New Experience**. Then, do the following:

    ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Shipping Experiences_

1.  Enter a descriptive **Name** for the new rule.

1.  For now, accept the default **Status** of `Draft`. When you are ready to _go live_ with the rule in your store, you can change Status to `Production`.

    _Experience Name and Status_

1.  Choose the type of rule that you want to create.

    This example shows how to create a **Qualify Rule**. Notice the icon and note before each section is mapped to the corresponding step in the shipment workflow. You can also hover your mouse over the information (![]({% link images/images/magento-shipping-portai-i-icon.png %})) icon for more information.

    -  In the rule section, click **Create Rule**.

       ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences-qualify-rules.png %}){: .zoom}
       _Create Rule_

    -  Enter a brief **Description** of the rule that states its purpose and the conditions that trigger the rule.

       ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences-qualify-rule-description.png %}){: .zoom}
       _Description_

    -  Set the Conditions for the rule:
       - In the **Conditions** section, choose the **Condition** and **Operator** that must be met to trigger the rule. For a combination of conditions, set the first condition and operator and click **Add Condition**.

          Think about conditions that are required to trigger the rule. For example, the condition might be “Country is China” or “Country is not China”. You can also combine multiple conditions, such as “Country is China or Hong Kong” or “Country is China and order items total weight is less than 50 pounds (lb)”.

          _Conditions_

       -  Choose the **Operator** that is needed to describe the condition. Then, do the following:

          ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences-condition-operator.png %}){: .zoom}
          _Choose an Operator_

       -  Complete the condition by entering appropriate values in the remaining field(s).

          ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences-condition-operator-country.png %}){: .zoom}
          _Complete the Condition_

       -  To add another condition, click **Add Condition**. Then, choose the logical operator that describes how the conditions are to be applied.

          -  **AND** – Triggers the rule when both the previous condition and the new condition are met.

          -  **OR** – Triggers the rule when either the previous condition, or the new condition is met.

          ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences-condition-multiple.png %}){: .zoom}
          _Add Another Condition_

       -  Repeat the previous steps to complete the new condition.

          ![]({% link images/images/shipping-magento-shipping-experiences-condition-multiple-complete.png %}){: .zoom}
          _Completed Condition_

    -  Set the Outcome for the rule:

       -  In the **Outcomes** section, choose the **Action** that applies when the conditions are met.

       -  Enter the **Shipping Method Label** that appears during checkout.

       -  Choose the **Currency** to be used to display the shipping charge.

       -  To add an additional action, click **Add Outcome**.
