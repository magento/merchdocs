title: Shipping Labels
---

Magento includes a high level of integration with major shipping carriers, which gives you access to carrier shipping systems to track orders, create shipping labels, and more. Shipping labels can be created for regular shipments and products with return merchandise authorization. In addition to the information provided by the shipping carrier, the label also includes the Magento order number, number of the package, and the total quantity of packages for the Magento shipment.
