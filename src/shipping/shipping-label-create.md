title: Creating Shipping Labels
---

To create shipping labels, you must first set up your shipping carrier account to support labels. Then, follow the prompts to enter a description of the package and its contents.

After you configure the shipping label information and submit an order, Magento connects to the shipping carrier system, submits an order, and receives a shipping label and a tracking number. If a shipping label for this shipment already exists in the system, it is replaced with a new one. However, existing tracking numbers are not replaced. Any new tracking number is added to the existing one.

## Step 1: Contact Your Shipping Carriers

Before you begin, make sure that your shipping accounts are set up to process labels. Some carriers might charge an additional fee to add shipping labels to your account.

Contact each carrier that you use to activate shipping labels for your store.

Follow the instructions provided by each carrier to add shipping label support to your account.

| FedEx | Contact [FedEx Web Services][1] regarding their label evaluation process. |
| USPS | Contact [uspstechsupport@esecurecare.net](mailto:uspstechsupport@esecurecare.net) to request that API Signature Confirmation V3 be enabled for your live USPS API Access account. |
| UPS | Contact [UPS][2] to confirm your account type supports shipping labels. To generate shipping labels, you must use the UPS XML option. |
| DHL | Contact the [DHL Resource Center][3] to learn more about their services or send an inquiry through their [Contact Center][3]. |

## Step 3 Create Shipping Labels

### Method 1: Create Label for New Shipment

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, click **Sales**.

1. In the _Operations_ section, choose **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid, and open the record.

    The status of the order must be either `Pending` or `Processing`.

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Ship**.

1. Confirm the shipping information according to carrier requirements.

1. In the lower-right corner, mark the **Create Shipping Label** checkbox.

1. Click **Submit Shipment**.

1. Add or update products in package:

    - To add products from the order to the package, click **Add Products**. The Quantity column shows the maximum number of products that are available for the package.

    - Mark the checkbox of each product to be added to the package, and enter the **Quantity** of each. Then, click **Add Selected Product(s) to Package**.

    - To add a new package, click **Add Package**.

    - To delete a package, click **Delete Package**.

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    If you use a package type other than the default, or require a signature, the cost of shipping might differ from what you have charged the customer. Any difference in the cost of shipping is not reflected in your store.

1. Click **OK**.

#### To cancel an order:

1. Click **Cancel**.

   A shipping label will not be created, and the Create Shipping Label checkbox is cleared. Magento connects to the shipping carrier system, submits the order, and receives a shipping label and tracking number for each package.

### Method 2: Create Label for Existing Shipment

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, click **Sales**.

1. In the _Operations_ section, choose **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid, and open the Shipping form. Then, do the following:

    - In the Shipping and Tracking Information section, click **Create Shipping Label**.

    - Distribute the ordered product(s) to the appropriate package(s), and click **OK**.

    - To review the package information, click **Show Packages**.

## Step 4: Print the Labels

Shipping labels are generated in PDF format, and can be printed from the Admin. Each label includes the order number and package number.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Because an individual shipment order for each package is created, multiple shipping labels might be received for a single shipment.

### Method 1: Print Label from Shipment Form

1. On the _Admin sidebar_, click **Sales**. Then, do one of the following:

    - Choose **Orders**. Find the order in the grid, and open the record. In the panel on the left, choose **Shipments**. Then, open the shipment record.

    - Choose **Shipments**. Find the order in the grid, and open the record.

1. To download the PDFÂ file, go to the Shipping and Tracking section of the form, and click **Print Shipping Label**.

    Depending on your browser settings, the shipping labels can be viewed and printed directly from the PDF file.

    The Print Shipping Label button appears only after the carrier generates labels for the shipment. If the button is missing, click **Create Shipping Label**. The button appears after Magento receives the label from the carrier.

### Method 2: Print Labels for Multiple Orders

1. On the Admin sidebar, click **Sales**.

1. Choose one of the following:

    - Orders
    - Shipments

1. In the grid, mark the checkbox of each order with shipping labels to be printed.

1. Set the **Actions** control to `Print Shipping Labels`.

1. Click **Submit**.

A complete set of shipping labels is printed for each shipment that is related to the selected orders.
