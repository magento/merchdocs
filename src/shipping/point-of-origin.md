title: Point of Origin
---

The point of origin is used to calculate the charge for shipments made from your store or warehouse, and also determines the tax rate for products sold. When calculating [EU taxes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tax/guidelines-eu.md %}), make sure that the [Default Tax Destination Calculation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link configuration/sales/tax.md %}) for each store view corresponds to the Shipping Settings point of origin.
