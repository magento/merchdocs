title: Configuring Shipping Labels
---

The following settings must be made at the product level, as well as in the configuration of each carrier that is used to print labels. To print labels, all carriers require that you open an account. Then, complete the configuration in your store for each carrier that you plan to use.

## Step 1: Verify the country of manufacture

The country of manufacture is required for all products that are shipped internationally by USPS and FedEx, If you have many products that need to be updated, you can either [import]({% link system/data-import.md %}) the updates, or use the Inventory grid to update multiple records.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Products**.

1. Update the shipping label record using one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Update a single record

1. In the grid, find the product to be updated, and open in edit mode.

1. In the _Advanced Settings_ section in the left panel, choose **Autosettings**.

1. Update the **Country of Manufacture** as needed.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

   _Country of Manufacture_

### Method 2: Update multiple records

1. In the grid, select the checkbox of each product to be updated.

   For example, all products that are manufactured in China.

1. In the _Update Attributes_ form, find the **Country of Manufacture** field and select the **Change** checkbox. Then, choose the country.

## Step 2 Verify the store information

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Shipping Settings**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Origin** section, and verify that the following fields are complete:

   - **Street Address** – The street address of the place from which shipments are sent. For example, the location of your company or warehouse. This field is required for shipping labels.

1. In the _Sales_ section in the left panel, choose **Delivery Methods**.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **USPS** section, and verify that the following fields are complete:

   - **Secure Gateway URL** – Magento automatically enters the gateway URL.
   - **Password** – The password is provided by USPS and gives you access to their system through Web Services.
   - **Length, Width, Height, Girth** – The default dimensions of the package. To make these fields appear, set **Size** to `Large`.

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **FedEx** section and verify that the following fields are complete:

   - Meter Number
   - Key
   - Password

   This information is provided by the carrier, and is required to gain access to their system through Web Services.

1. In the left panel, expand **General** and choose **General** underneath.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Store Information** section and verify that the following fields are complete:

   - **Store Name** – The name of the store or store view.
   - **Store Contact Telephone** – The telephone number of the primary contact for the store or store view.
   - **Country** – The country where your store is based.
   - **VAT Number** – If applicable the Value Added Tax number of your store. (Not required for stores based in the U.S.)
   - **Store Contact Address** – The street address of the primary contact for the store or store view.

1. If you have multiple stores and the contact information differs from the default, set **Store View** for each and verify that the information is complete.

   If the information is missing, an error will appear when you try to print the labels.
