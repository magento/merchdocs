If you have a commercial account with a supported carrier, you can offer your customers the convenience of choosing that carrier during checkout. The rates are automatically downloaded, so you do not need to look up the information.

Before you can offer your customers a selection of shipping carriers, you must complete the following steps:

* Configure the [shipping settings]({% link shipping/shipping-settings.md %}) to establish the point of origin for your store.

* Configure the settings for each carrier service that you want to offer.

   [**UPS**]({% link shipping/ups.md %})|United Parcel Service (UPS) offers domestic and international shipping services by land and air to more than 220 countries.|
   [**USPS**]({% link shipping/usps.md %})|The United States Postal Service (USPS) is the independent postal service of United States government. USPS offers domestic and international shipping services by land and air.|
   [**FedEx**]({% link shipping/fedex.md %})|FedEx offers domestic and international shipping services by land and air to more than 220 countries.|
   [**DHL**]({% link shipping/dhl.md %})|DHL offers integrated international services and tailored, customer-focused solutions for managing and transporting letters, goods and information.|

The configuration options vary for each carrier. However, all require the following steps:

1. Open a shipping account with the carrier.

1. Enter your account number or user ID, and the gateway URL to their system into the configuration of your store.
