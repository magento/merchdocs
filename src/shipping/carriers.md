title: Shipping Carriers
---

If you have a commercial account with a supported carrier, you can offer your customers the convenience of choosing that carrier during checkout. The rates are automatically downloaded, so you do not need to look up the information.

Before you can offer your customers a selection of shipping carriers, you must complete the following steps:

* Configure the [shipping settings]({% link shipping/shipping-settings.md %}) to establish the point of origin for your store.

* Configure the settings for each carrier service that you want to offer.

The configuration options vary for each carrier. However, all require the following stops:

1. Open a shipping account with the carrier.

1. Enter your account number or user ID, and the gateway URL to their system into the configuration of your store. See [Magento Connect]({% link magento/magento-marketplace.md %}) for additional shipping services for your Magento installation.
