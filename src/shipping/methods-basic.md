Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source support a wide range of delivery methods, as well as shipping carriers. There are some basic delivery methods that do not require an account with a third-party provider:

* [Free Shipping]({% link shipping/shipping-free.md %})

* [Flat Rate]({% link shipping/shipping-flat-rate.md %})

* [Table Rates]({% link shipping/shipping-table-rate.md %})

* [In-Store Delivery]({% link shipping/shipping-in-store-delivery.md %})

* [Dimensional Weight]({% link shipping/weight-dimensional.md %})

If you are using [Inventory Management]({% link catalog/inventory.md %}), you can also set up sources to provide in-store delivery options for your customers.
