title: Issuing a Credit Memo
---

Before a credit memo can be printed, it must first be generated for an invoiced order. You can issue both online and offline refunds from an open credit memo, depending on the payment method.

- {:.ee-only}Refunds can be applied to store credit.
- {:.b2b-only}Refunds can be applied to company credit.
- Purchases made by credit card can be refunded either online or offline.
- Purchases made by check or money order must be refunded offline.

## Payment action configuration

Any credit memo with a [status]({% link sales/order-status.md %}) of `Open` has an outstanding refund due. The refund workflow for orders paid by credit card is determined by the _Payment Action_ setting in the [configuration of the payment method]({% link configuration/sales/payment-methods.md %}). Refunds cannot be issued until the transaction is settled.

- If Payment Action is set to `Authorize`, you must first generate the invoice from the Magento Admin before a credit memo can be created.
- If Payment Action is set to `Authorize and Capture`, the invoice has already been generated by the payment processor, but the funds are not available until the transaction is settled. This brief waiting period is recommended by many payment processors as a security measure and can usually be handled automatically. Transactions can also be settled manually from your merchant account with the payment processor.

If you are using [Vertex Cloud]({% link tax/vertex.md %}), see the [Vertex Settings]({% link configuration/sales/tax.md %}) configuration section for information about issuing refunds for sales orders that are invoiced when the status is either `SuspectedÂ Fraud` or `Canceled`.

## Create a credit memo

Determine the type of refund that you want to issue. Then, use one of the following methods to generate the credit memo and issue a refund.

- {:.ee-only}If you create a credit memo for an order that includes gift options, the refund for the gift wrapping and/or printed card appears in the _Refund Totals_ section of the credit memo. To exclude these costs from the amount to be refunded, enter the amount as an _Adjustment Fee_. If multiple credit memos are issued for the same order, the refund for gift options appears in only the first credit memo.
