title: Issuing a Credit Memo
---

Before a credit memo can be printed, it must first be generated for an [invoiced order]({% link sales/invoice-create.md %}). You can issue both online and offline refunds (partial or full) from an open credit memo, depending on the payment method.

- {:.ee-only}Refunds can be applied to store credit.
- {:.b2b-only}Refunds can be applied to company credit.
- Purchases made by credit card can be refunded either online or offline.
- Purchases made by check or money order must be refunded offline.

Any credit memo with an [open status]({% link sales/order-status.md %}) has an outstanding refund due.

With credit memos you can:

- Refund the full amount of an invoice.
- Refund a partial amount of an invoice.
- Refund multiple partial amounts of an invoice.
- Refund multiple invoices per order, not to exceed the total order amount.
- Refund a portion of the quantity for one line item, such as three of the five shirts in an order.

See [Creating an invoice]({% link sales/invoice-create.md %}) for more information.

## Payment action setting

The refund workflow for orders paid by credit card is determined by the [Payment Action setting]({% link configuration/sales/payment-methods.md %}) in the configuration for each available payment method. Refunds cannot be issued until the transaction is settled.

![]({% link images/images/config-payment-methods-braintree-payment-action-authorize-capture.png %}){: .zoom}
_Payment Action Setting_

- If the Payment Action for your configured payment method is set to `Authorize`, you must first generate the invoice from the Magento Admin before a credit memo can be created.
- If Payment Action for your configured payment method is set to `Authorize and Capture`, the invoice has already been generated by the payment processor, but the funds aren't available until the transaction is settled. This brief waiting period is recommended by many payment processors as a security measure, and can usually be handled automatically. Transactions can also be settled manually from your merchant account with the payment processor.
- {:.ee-only}If you create a credit memo for an order that includes gift options, the refund for the gift wrapping and/or printed card appears in the Refund Totals section of the credit memo. To exclude these costs from the amount to be refunded, enter the amount as an Adjustment Fee. If multiple credit memos are issued for the same order, the refund for gift options appears in only the first credit memo.

If you are using [Vertex Cloud]({% link tax/vertex.md %}), see the [Vertex Settings]({% link configuration/sales/tax.md %}) configuration section for information about issuing refunds for sales orders that are invoiced when the status is either `SuspectedÂ Fraud` or `Canceled`.

## Create a credit memo

Determine the type of refund that you want to issue---for a [credit purchase](#issue-a-refund-for-a-credit-purchase) or for [check or money order](#issue-an-offline-refund-for-check-or-money-order)---and generate the credit memo and issue a refund.

      The amount entered cannot raise the total refund higher than the paid amount.
