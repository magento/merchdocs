Archiving orders on a regular basis improves performance and keeps your workspace free of unnecessary information, so you can focus on current business. Invoices, shipments, and credit memos can be archived automatically or manually, and can be viewed at any time.

{:.bs-callout-info}
The Archive option appears in the Sales menu only when archiving is [enabled]({% link configuration/sales/sales.md %}).

_[Move Order to Archive]({% link configuration/sales/sales.md %})_

## Enable archiving

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, click **Stores**.

1. In the _Settings_ section, choose **Configuration**.

1. In the _Sales_ section on the left panel, choose **Sales**.

1. Expand the **Orders, Invoices, Shipments, Credit Memos Archiving** section, and do the following:

    - Set **Enable Archiving** to `Yes`.

    - Set **Archive Orders Purchased** to the number of days to wait before completed orders are archived.

        By default, orders are archived thirty days after the purchase.

    - In the **Order Statuses to be Archived** list, select each order status to use for identifying orders to archive. To select multiple items, hold down the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac) key as you click each item.

1. Click **Save Config**.

  Adobe Commerce Support recommends enabling Order archiving to save MySQL disk space and improve checkout performance. See [Best practices for order placement performance ](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048170772) in Adobe Commerce Support Knowledge Base.

## Manually archive an order

1. In the _Operations_ section, choose **Orders**.

1. To select the order on the grid, mark the checkbox in the first column.

    ![]({% link images/images-ee/order-select-in-grid.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Mark the Order(s) to Archive_
