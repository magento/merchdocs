A returned merchandise authorization (RMA) can be granted to customers who request to return an item for replacement or refund. Typically the customer contacts the merchant to request a refund. If approved, a unique RMA number is assigned to identify the returned product. In the configuration, you can either enable RMA for all products or allow RMA for only certain products. The Returns grid lists the current returned merchandise requests (RMAs) and is used to enter new return requests.

RMAs can be issued for simple, grouped, configurable, and bundle product types. However, RMAs are not available for virtual products, downloadable products, and gift cards.
