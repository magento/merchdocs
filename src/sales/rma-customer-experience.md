Customers can use either of the following to request an RMA from the storefront:

- [Orders and Returns Widget]({% link cms/widget-orders-returns.md %}) in sidebar
- _Orders and Returns_ link in footer

As a best practice, make sure to include a description of your RMA requirements and process in the Customer Service policy.
