title: Redirect to Cart
---

The shopping cart page can be configured to appear whenever an item is added to the cart, or only when customers choose to go to the page. The basic information about the items currently in the cart is always available in the [mini cart]({% link sales/mini-cart.md %}). The decision is a matter of balancing the benefits of letting customers continue shopping, with the benefits of encouraging customers to proceed to checkout. It might be a simple matter of personal preference. However, if you want to back it up with numbers, you can run an A/B test to see which approach produces a higher conversion rate.

## Configure when the cart appears

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Checkout**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the **Shopping Cart** section.

   ![The shopping cart configuration settings expanded on the page]({% link images/images/config-sales-checkout-shopping-cart.png %}){: .zoom}
   [_Shopping cart configuration settings_]({% link configuration/sales/checkout.md %})

1. If the setting is for a specific store view, [choose the store view]({% link configuration/scope-change.md %}) where the configuration applies.

   When prompted, click **OK** to continue.

1. Set **After Adding a Product Redirect to Shopping Cart** to one of the following:

   Yes|Displays the shopping cart page immediately after a product is added to the cart.|
   No|Disables redirect to the shopping cart after a product addition to the cart.|

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
