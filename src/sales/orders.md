title: Orders

The Orders workspace lists all current orders in descending order from latest purchase date. Each row in the grid represents an order, and each column represents an attribute, or data field. By default, orders display in descending order from latest to earliest purchase date. Use the standard [controls]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) to sort and filter the list, find orders, and apply [actions]({% link stores/admin-actions-control.md %}) to selected orders. You can view existing orders, and create new orders. The tabs above the pagination controls can be used to filter the list, change the default view, change and rearrange columns, and export data.
