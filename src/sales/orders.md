title: Orders

The Orders grid lists all current orders and tracks their progress and [order status]({% link sales/order-status.md %}) through the [workflow]({% link sales/order-workflow.md %}). An easy way to understand the basic process is that an order becomes an [invoice]({% link sales/invoices.md %}), and an invoice becomes a [shipment]({% link sales/shipments.md %}). The Orders grid represents the first stage of the process, and is where you can [update]({% link sales/order-update.md %}) existing orders and create new orders. 

Orders are usually created when customers complete the checkout process from the storefront. However, if a customer needs [assistance]({% link sales/shopping-assistance.md %}), you can also access their [shopping cart]({% link sales/shopping-assisted-cart-manage.md %}) or [create an order]({% link customers/customer-account-create-order.md %}) either from the Orders grid or directly from their customer account.
