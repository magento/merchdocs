When helping a customer who has placed an order, you need to determine the status of the order. The available options for a `Pending` order are different than the options for a `Processing` order. For more information, see [Processing an Order]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}).

## Pending orders

After a customer places an order, but before the payment is received, the order is in `Pending` status. You can edit the order, place it on hold, or cancel it entirely. The button bar of a pending order lists the available actions for an order.

_Pending Order Options_

If you modify the substance of an order, the original order is canceled and a new order is generated. You can, however, change the billing or shipping address without generating a new order.

### Button bar

|Button|Description|
|--- |--- |
|<span class="btn">Back</span>|Returns to the Orders page without saving changes.|
|<span class="btn">Login as Customer</span>|Allows an admin user to assist customers with their orders.|
|<span class="btn">Cancel</span>|Cancels the pending order.|
|<span class="btn">Send Email</span>|Sends an email about the pending order to the customer.|
|<span class="btn">Hold</span> / <span class="btn">Unhold</span>|Changes the status of the pending order to _On Hold_. To release the hold, choose `Unhold`.|
|<span class="btn">Invoice</span>|Creates an [invoice]({% link sales/invoice-create.md %}) from the pending order by converting the order to an invoice, and changes the order status to `processing`.|
|<span class="btn">Ship</span>|Creates a [shipment]({% link sales/shipments-create.md %}) record for the order.|
|<span class="btn">Reorder</span>|Creates a new pending order that is a duplicate of the current pending order.|
|<span class="btn">Edit</span>|Opens a pending order in edit mode. The Edit button is only available for pending orders, or for orders based on negotiated [quotes]({% link sales/quotes.md %}).|

## Processing orders

An order enters a `Processing` state when:

* The payment for an order is received/captured and the invoice is generated. This happens when the payment action is set to `Authorize and Capture`.
* An order transaction is authorized, but payment is not yet captured. This happens when the payment action is set to `Authorize`.

The [payment action configuration]({% link configuration/sales/payment-methods.md %}#payment-actions) determines which order actions are available after an order is created.

You cannot change the substance of a `Processing` order, but you can edit the billing and shipping address.

When the payment action of the payment method is set to `Authorize and Capture`, an invoice is automatically created when the customer places an order. In this circumstance, you can refund funds using a [credit memo]({% link sales/credit-memo-create.md %}), but cannot [cancel](#cancel-a-pending-order) or [void](#void-a-processing-order) the order.

|<span class="ee-only"></span><span class="btn">Create Returns</span>|Initiates the process to [return]({% link sales/returns.md %}) one or more items from the order.|

## Void a processing order

When an order is still in a `Processing` status and the payment integration is set to `Authorize` (not `Authorize and Capture`), you can only void a transaction or cancel an order. [Canceling an order](#cancel-a-pending-order) also voids the authorization.

When an order is placed using a payment method with the payment action set to `Authorize and Capture` you can refund the funds via credit memo,  but cannot cancel it because it is invoiced and payment is captured.

Your payment method determines your available payment actions. See [Payment actions]({% link configuration/sales/payment-methods.md %}#payment-actions) for more information.

To void an order:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > _Operations_ > **Orders**.

1. In the **Action** column for the order to be edited, click **View**.

1. Click **Void** to void the order.

1. At the prompt, click **OK** to void the order.

You can issue any needed refunds via [credit memo]({% link sales/credit-memo-create.md %}) after funds have been captured. You can also create a [return merchandise authorization (RMA)]({% link sales/returns.md %}) issued for product returns. To learn more, see [Processing an Order]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}).

## Edit a pending order

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > _Operations_ > **Orders**.

1. In the **Action** column for the order to be edited, click **View**.

1. Click **Edit**.

1. At the prompt, click **OK** to continue editing.

1. Update the order as needed.

    _Edit Order_

1. Apply your changes:
   * To save changes made to the billing or shipping address, click **Save**.
   * To save changes made to line items, and reprocess the order, click **Submit Order**.

## Place an order on hold

If the customerâ€™s preferred method of payment is not available or if the item is temporarily out of stock, you can place the order on hold.

1. In the _Orders_ grid, find the `Pending` order that you want to place on hold.

1. In the _Action_ column, click **View**.

1. Click **Hold** to place the order on hold.

    _Hold Order_

To remove the hold on an order, edit the order again and click **Unhold**.

## Cancel a pending order

Canceling an order changes its status from `Pending` to `Canceled`.

1. In the _Orders_ grid, find the pending order to be canceled.

1. In the _Action_ column, click **View**.

1. Click **Cancel** to cancel the order.
