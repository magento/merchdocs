During its lifecycle, a returned merchandise authorization (RMA) can have many assigned statuses (such as Pending, Authorized, etc.). The RMA status indicates the progress of an RMA request raised by the user or the merchant.

## RMA status

|Pending|This is the initial status assigned to an RMA request when it is raised by a user on the storefront or by the merchant in the Admin.|
|Authorized|This status is assigned to the RMA when all requested items are authorized by the merchant in the Admin for the returns.|
|Partially Authorized|This status is assigned to the RMA if any of the requested items have been denied and other products are authorized.|
|Denied|This status is assigned to the RMA if all the requested items are rejected by the merchant in the Admin for the returns.|
|Return Received|This status is assigned by the merchant to the RMA when the requested items are received from the user.|
