The _Shipments_ grid lists the shipment record of all invoices that have been prepared for shipping. A shipment record can be generated when an order is [invoiced]({% link sales/invoices.md %}) or later.

Magento supports partial and complete order shipment, with additional options depending on [Inventory Management]({% link catalog/inventory.md %}), [Magento Shipping]({% link shipping/magento-shipping.md %}), and third party extensions.
