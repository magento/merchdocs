The _Shipments_ grid lists the shipment record of all invoices that have been prepared for shipping. A shipment record can be generated when an order is [invoiced]({% link sales/invoices.md %}) or later.

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source support partial and complete order shipment, with additional options available from [Inventory Management]({% link catalog/inventory.md %}) and third-party extensions.
