The order confirmation appears after the order is placed. For registered customers, the page includes the order number with a link to the customer’s account, and a link to generate a receipt. Registered customers are told that they will receive order confirmation and tracking info by email. Guests are encouraged to create an account to track the order. Registered customers can generate a receipt by clicking a link.

The order confirmation page is also called the _Success_ page, and is used by analytics programs to track conversions.
