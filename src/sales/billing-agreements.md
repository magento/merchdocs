The _Billing Agreements_ page lists all PayPal [billing agreements]({% link payment/paypal-billing-agreements.md %}) between your store and its customers. The store administrator can filter the records by the customer or billing agreement information, including billing agreement reference ID, status, and creation date. Each record includes general information about the billing agreement, and all sales orders that have used it as a payment method. A store administrator can view, cancel, or delete customer billing agreements. A canceled billing agreement can be deleted only by the store administrator.
