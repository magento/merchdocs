title: Gift Wrap
---

Gift wrapping is available for any product that can be shipped, and can be offered for individual items or for the entire order. You can charge a separate price for each gift wrap design, and upload a thumbnail image for each design that appears as an option for a product in the cart. When a customer clicks the gift wrap thumbnail, a full-size image appears. During checkout review, the gift wrap charge appears with the other [checkout totals]({% link sales/checkout-totals-sort-order.md %}) in the _Order Summary_ section.

The gift wrap image should be a swatch that shows the repeating pattern, and can also include a sample of the ribbon that is to be used. You can either scan the paper, or take a photograph of a wrapped package. The uploaded image can be a GIF, JPG, or PNG image, and should be square. In the following example, the uploaded gift wrap image is 230 x 230 pixels.
