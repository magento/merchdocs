title: In-store Pickup
---

The In-store pickup (ISPU) functionality allows a customer to place their order online and collect the order items from a physical store. The Order Management System (OMS) provides a web-based interface to allow the store associate to pick and prepare the items for customer collection.

Exceptions, such as items not able to be picked, can be handled simply and cleanly from this interface. The UI employs responsive design, which is a mobile-first methodology (meaning it can be used from a tablet device, such as an iPad, or a mobile phone).
