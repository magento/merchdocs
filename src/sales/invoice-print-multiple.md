title: Printing Multiple Invoices
---

Invoices can be printed individually or as a batch. However, before an invoice can be printed, it must first be generated for the order. To add your logo and address to the invoice, see: [Preparing Your Invoice Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/sales-document-pdf-logo.md %}).
