Your store can be configured to archive orders, invoices, shipments, and credit memos after a set number of days. You can move orders and their associated documents to the archive, or restore them to their previous state. Archived orders are not deleted and remain available from the Admin. Archived data can be exported to a CSV file and opened in a spreadsheet. When enabled, the "Archive" command appears at the top of the workspace.
