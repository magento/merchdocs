When the checkout process begins, the transaction shifts to a secure, encrypted channel. A padlock symbol appears in the address bar of the browser, and the URL changes from `http` to `https`.

From this point on, the goal is to gather the information necessary to complete the transaction. The Checkout page leads the customer through each step of the process. Customers who are logged into their accounts can complete checkout quickly, because much of the information is already in their accounts. Customers associated with a company account that uses purchase orders will have a slightly different workflow.

## Shipping

The first step of the checkout process is for the customer to complete the shipping address information, and to choose the shipping method. If the customer has an account, the shipping address is entered automatically, but can be changed if needed.

- {:.ee-only}The format of the street address for the recipient and sender is determined by the properties of the [customer address attribute]({% link stores/attributes-customer-address.md %}). The input validation setting determines the valid characters that can be used in a shipping address.

The progress bar at the top of the page follows each step of the checkout process, and the Order Summary shows the information entered so far.
