title: Custom Order Status
---

In addition to the preset order status settings, you can create custom order status settings of your own, assign them to order states, and set a default order status for order states. For example, you might need a custom order status such as “packaging”, “backordered”, or a status that is specific to your needs. You can create a descriptive name for the custom status and assign it to the associated order state in the workflow.

Only default custom order status values are used in the order workflow. Custom status values that are not set as default can be used only in the comments section of the order.

1. In the _Action_ column on the far right of the row, click the **Unassign** link.

   A message appears at the top of the workspace that the order status has been unassigned. Although the order status label still appears in the list, it is no longer assigned to a state. Order status settings cannot be deleted.
