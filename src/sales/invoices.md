An invoice is a record of the record of payment for an order. Multiple invoices can be [created]({% link sales/invoice-create.md %}) for a single order, and each can include as many or as few of the purchased products that you specify. You can also create [print-ready PDF invoices]({% link sales/invoice-print.md %}) as sales documents for your customers.

On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > _Operations_ > **Invoices** to open the _Invoices_ grid and access your created invoices.
