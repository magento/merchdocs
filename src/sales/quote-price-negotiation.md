title: Negotiating a Quote
---

If [B2B Quotes]({% link stores/b2b-features.md %}) are enabled in the configuration, an authorized buyer from a company initiates the price negotiation process by [requesting a quote]({% link sales/quote-request.md %}) from the shopping cart. Requests for quotes received are listed in the [Quotes]({% link sales/quotes.md %}) grid. All negotiation between the buyer and seller takes place by email, and is initiated and tracked from the detail view of the quote.

During the negotiation process, the seller can do the following:

- Add or remove products
- Change the quantity
- Apply a discount to the total price
- Add or change the shipping method
- Add comments
- Send the updated quote to the buyer, or save as a draft

While the quote is open for review, its status in the buyer’s account is set to `Pending`. The buyer can change and resubmit the quote even if it was declined or is expired.

## Step 1: View the request

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar go to **Sales** > **Quotes**.

   The new request appears in the Quotes grid.

## Step 4:  Follow up on a quote

- Accept the negotiated quote and complete the purchase.
- Send a reply with a counter offer to continue the negotiation.
- Ends the negotiation.

Check your email and the status of the quote in the grid to monitor its position in the workflow. You can continue the negotiation process as long as needed.
