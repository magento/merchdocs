title: Order Workspace
---

The Order workspace lists all current orders. Each row in the grid represents a customer order, and each column represents an attribute, or data field . Use the standard [controls]({% link stores/admin-grid-controls.md %}) to sort and filter the list, find orders, and apply [actions]({% link stores/admin-actions-control.md %}) to selected orders. From the grid, you can view existing orders, and create new orders. The tabs above the pagination controls are used to filter the list, change the default view, change and rearrange columns, and export data.
