You can determine how long a price is valid by setting the cart quote lifetime in the configuration. For example, if a shopper leaves a cart unattended after several days, the quotes price for some items might no longer be the same. By default, the quote lifetime is set to thirty days.

## Configure the quote lifetime

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Checkout**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the **Shopping Cart** section.

   ![The shopping cart configuration settings expanded on the page]({% link configuration/sales/assets/checkout-shopping-cart.png %}){: .zoom}
   [_Shopping cart configuration settings_]({% link configuration/sales/checkout.md %})

1. If the setting is for a specific store view, [choose the store view]({% link configuration/scope-change.md %}) where the configuration applies.

   When prompted, click **OK** to continue.

1. For **Quote Lifetime (days)**, enter the number of days that a quoted price remains valid.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
