Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source reduce ordering errors by automatically verifying the SKU and availability of all items before an order is submitted. In this section of the guide, you’ll learn how to configure the cart and checkout options, and offer assistance to your customers.

{:.bs-callout-tip}
<span class="b2b-only"></span> With the installation and enablement of B2B for Adobe Commerce, you can configure Quick Order for customers associated with a company account. This reduces the order process to several clicks when they know the name or SKU of the products they want to order. You can also configure support for negotiated quotes for your company accounts. For more information about the B2B features, see the [B2B for Adobe Commerce User Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/introduction.html).
