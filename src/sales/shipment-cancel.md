title: Canceling a Shipment
---

Before a shipment is dispatched to a carrier, it can be canceled by opening the order and navigating to the shipment, provided the carrier supports cancellations. Some carriers restrict or limit cancellations after a booking. For example, UPS allows cancellations, but requires that you wait 24 hours after the shipment is booked. If a shipment is canceled, the cancellation cannot be reversed. The only recourse is to recreate the order.

## Cancel a shipment

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid.

1. In the _Action_ column, choose **View**.

1. In the left panel, choose **Shipments**.

   If the shipment can be canceled, _Cancel Shipment_ appears as an option in the top button bar.

1. Click <span class="btn">Cancel Shipment</span>.

1. When prompted to confirm, click <span class="btn">OK</span>.

The status of the shipment changes to `Canceled`. If the carrier does not support cancellations, an error message appears and explains why the shipment could not be canceled.
