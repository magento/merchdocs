When a customer places an order, a sales order is created as a temporary record of the transaction. The sales order has a status of `Pending` until payment is received. While in `Pending` status, orders can be edited or canceled up until the time that payment is received and an invoice is generated. An easy way to think of it is that orders become invoices, and invoices become shipments. The Orders grid lists all orders, regardless of where they are in the [workflow]({% link sales/order-workflow.md %}). To learn how to help customers with an order, see [Updating an Order]({% link sales/order-update.md %}).

## View an order

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > _Operations_ > **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid.

1. In the _Action_ column, click **View**.

1. Check order status:

   - A `Pending` order can be modified, put on hold, canceled, or invoiced and shipped.

   - A `Processing` order can no longer edit the substance of or cancel the order, but the billing and shipping address can be edited.

   - A `Completed` order can be reordered.

The customer's email may be edited at any point in the order workflow by editing the customer. The email cannot be edited if the order was placed by a guest.

The left panel for an open order provides access to different types of information that is related to the order.

_Edit Sales Order_

Review the following sections in the sales order, using the field descriptions for reference.

## Cancel an order

You can [cancel]({% link sales/order-update.md %}) orders that are not yet invoiced. A [credit memo]({% link sales/credit-memos.md %}) must be issued if a customer wants to cancel an order after it is invoiced (payment is captured).

If an order is `Pending` or `Processing` and the payment is not captured or not entirely captured, you can [void the order](#void-an-order) instead of canceling it.

To restore a canceled order, click the `Reorder` button and a new order is created with the status `Pending`.

{:.bs-callout-info}
Canceling an order also produces a void, but voiding an order does not trigger a cancellation.

## Void an order

Only sales orders that are not invoiced, have a status of `Processing`, and a [payment integration setting of `Authorize`]({% link configuration/sales/payment-methods.md %}#payment-actions), can be [voided]({% link sales/order-update.md %}#void-a-processing-order). After you void an order, you can cancel it.
