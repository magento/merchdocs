Invoices can be printed individually or as a batch. However, before an invoice can be printed, it must first be generated for the order. You can upload a high-resolution logo for a print-ready PDF invoice, and include the [Order ID]({% link marketing/sales-documents-ref-id.md %}) in the header. To customize the invoice template with your logo and address, see [PDF Logo Requirements]({% link marketing/sales-document-pdf-logo.md %}).

To view or print the PDF, you must have a PDF reader. You can download [Adobe Reader][1] at no charge.
