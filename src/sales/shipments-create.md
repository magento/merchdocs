---

**To create a shipment:**

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, choose **Sales**.

1. Choose **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid, and open it.

1. If the order is paid, invoiced, and ready to ship, click **Ship**.

    The sections at the top of the shipment contain name and address and payment information from the sales order.

1. Complete each section of the shipment form using the instructions in the following sections.

## Source Selection (Inventory Management)

If you have Inventory Management enabled, select a [source]({% link catalog/inventory-sources.md %}) (or location) and an amount of quantity to send per line item.

For complete details, see [Creating Shipments with Inventory Management]({% link catalog/inventory-shipment-create.md %}).

## Items Ordered

The default value is the Magento Customer ID, but you can specify another value up to 15 characters.

## Route Information

**To configure the route options:**

     For Magento Shipping, the default [location]({% link shipping/magento-shipping-locations.md %}) is entered automatically, but can be overridden as necessary.

## Packages

In the catalog database, make sure that the weight is entered correctly for all products to be shipped.

### To use Magento Shipping packaging:

1. Complete the [packaging setup]({% link shipping/magento-shipping-packaging.md %}), as needed.

    Magento Shipping presents a list of predefined carrier packaging after the carrier connects. The list includes all package types offered by the carrier, and the pricing and associated services are updated automatically from the carrier.

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    The package configuration grid lists only merchant-defined packaging. Carrier-specific packaging does not appear in the grid.

1. Choose the package type.

    After you choose a package type, the length, width, height, and dimension unit are automatically entered. The following determinations are made to calculate the package weight:

    - The weight of the package, as specified in the catalog for each shippable product.
    - The tare weight of the selected package type.
    - The sum of all product weights in the package, as well as the tare weight of the package.

     An error occurs if the weight of all items in the package exceeds the maximum weight allowed for the package. The total weight is recalculated whenever the package type or quantity ordered changes. A warning appears below the Total Weight field, as a reminder to verify the values and make any changes necessary.

### To enter merchant-defined packaging:

1. In the _Packages_ section, choose the **Package Type**.

    - If you choose a prepared package type profile, the measurements are entered automatically.

    - If you choose a Custom package, you must enter the **Length**, **Width**, and **Height** of the package. Then in the **Dim. Units** field, enter the number of dimensional units used by the package in the delivery vehicle or container.

    When you enter the **Weight** of the package, you can also set the **Weight Units** field to a different unit of measurement that is used for weight.

1. To change the number of ordered items that are packed in the shipment, update the value in the **Contents** field.

    After you change the value, the **Quantity Packed** value updates to reflect the change.
