Before you proceed with setup and configuration, make sure that you have the information that you need to access the Admin of your store and your Commerce account.

## Storefront URL

The address for your storefront is usually the domain that is assigned to your IP address. Some stores are installed at the root, or topmost directory. Others are installed in a directory below the root. Your store might be located in a subdomain that is associated with your primary domain. Your store URL might look like one of the following:

- `http://mydomain.com`
- `http://www.mydomain.com/mystore`
- `http://www.mydomain.com/mystore`
- `http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`

If you do not yet have a domain, your store URL will include a series of four numbers, each separated by a period in _dotted quad_ notation.

## Admin URL

The address for your store Admin is set up during the installation. The default address is the same as your store, but with /admin at the end. Although the examples in this guide use the default directory, we recommend that run your Admin from a location that is unique to your store.

- `http://mydomain.com/admin`
- `http://www.mydomain.com/admin`

## Commerce account

Your [Commerce account]({% link magento/magento-account.md %}) provides access to information about your products and services, account settings, billing history, and support resources. To access your account, go to the main Commerce site and click the _My Account_ ![]({% link images/images/btn-account.png %}) icon in the upper-right corner.

## Customer account

While you are learning your way around the store, make sure to set up a test [customer account]({% link customers/customer-account.md %}), so you can experience the store and checkout process from the customer’s perspective.

## For your records

As a best practice, keep a record of the details of your installation, your login credentials, and the email address that is associated with each account. Make sure to log the following information and keep it in a secured, convenient place.
