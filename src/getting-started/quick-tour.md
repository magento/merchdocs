This quick tour takes a look at each page that customers usually visit while shopping in your store. The path that customers typically follow to a sale is sometimes called the _path to purchase_. It also takes a look at the major landmarks along the journey, and considers how Magento can be used to attract and engage customers, increase the average order, and build loyalty and advocacy.
