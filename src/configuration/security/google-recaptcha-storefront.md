The reCAPTCHA type you choose must match the type that is associated with the API key from your Google reCAPTCHA account.

When using reCAPTCHA version 3, a genuine user with low score cannot proceed. For version 2, a genuine user with a low score receives a challenge. Consider carefully if genuine users with a low score should have an opportunity to solve a challenge (version 2) or be completely blocked (version 3).
