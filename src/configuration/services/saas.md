Magento allows you to link your Magento store to a SaaS service through the Admin UI. By configuring and managing SaaS Environments, you can connect to services such as Product Recommendations.

When you create a [Magento account]({% link magento/magento-account.md %}), identified by a MageID, you can generate a Magento API key to connect to the SaaS services within Magento. To connect to Magento Commerce SaaS services, the API key needs to be generated by the license-holder. Then the API key can be passed to the systems integrator or development team, who can then manage the SaaS projects and environments on behalf of the license-holder.

Each MageID can have one SaaS project and within that SaaS project you can have one or more SaaS environments depending on whether or not you have a license:

-  **Magento Commerce** - One production environment; two testing environments

-  **Magento Open Source** - One production environment; no testing environments

SaaS projects and environments are separate but analogous concepts to Magento Cloud projects and environments.

## Create SaaS Environment

To create a SaaS Environment, request the Magento API key from the Magento license holder for your store.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to  **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1.  In the left panel, expand **Services** and choose **Magento Services**.

1. In the **API Keys** section, paste your key value into the **Production Api Key** field regardless of whether you are in a production environment or non-production environment.

1. Click **Save Config**.

   When you save, if there are any SaaS projects associated with your API key, those projects will appear in the the **SaaS Project** field located in the **SaaS Environment** section.

1. If there are not any SaaS projects created, click the **Request New Project** to display the **Project Name** field and enter a name for your SaaS project.

   Magento creates a SaaS project and the number of SaaS environments you are entitled to.

1. Select the **SaaS Environment** to use for the current configuration of your Magento store.

To change the SaaS project or environment names, click the **Rename this Project** or **Rename this Environment** respectively.
