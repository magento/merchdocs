3-D Secure was developed by Visa in the early 2000s to promote secure online transactions. Examples of 3-D Secure solutions created by card networks are Verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode, American Express SafeKey, and CardinalCommerce Consumer Authentication. CardinalCommerce is a global leader in digital transaction authentication, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa.

3-D Secure version 2.0 supports numerous enhancements, including advanced authentication methods and authentication flow, and improved data sharing between merchant and issuer.
