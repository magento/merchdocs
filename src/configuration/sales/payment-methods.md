See the Basic settings section of each individual payment method topic for a comprehensive list of individual configuration options.

|Authorization |Approves the purchase, but puts hold on the funds. The amount is not withdrawn until is captured by the merchant.
|Authorize |Authorizes the buyer's account for the order total but does not capture the payment. Capture payment by creating an invoice. Authorized orders can be voided or canceled.
