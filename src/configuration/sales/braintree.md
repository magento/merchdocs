**Commerce 2.4 Migration:**<br />
Prior to Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.4.0, it was recommended that merchants install and configure the official Braintree payment integration extension from the [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree) to replace the core integration. As of 2.4.0, the extension is now included in the core release.<br/><br/>
When migrating to Commerce 2.4 merchants will need to uninstall the extension distributed on the Marketplace (`paypal/module-braintree` or `gene/module-braintree`) and update any code customizations to use the `PayPal_Braintree` namespace instead of `Magento_Braintree`. Configuration settings from the Braintree Payments bundled extension for Commerce and the extension distributed on the Commerce Marketplace will be persisted and payments placed with those versions of the extension can still be captured, voided, or refunded as normal.<br /><br />
If you are upgrading to Commerce 2.4.0 and were not using the recommended Commerce Marketplace extension in your previous 2.3.x version, the multi address feature will not work with the 2.4.0 version of Braintree. When a shopper selects the _deliver to multiple addresses_ option, the Braintree payment method will not appear. Be aware that the Commerce Marketplace Extension previously recommended for 2.3.x has this multiple address issue.
