**Magento 2.4 Migration:**<br />
Prior to Magento 2.4.0, it was recommended that merchants install and configure the official Braintree payment integration extension from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree) to replace the core integration. As of Magento 2.4.0, the extension is now included in the Magento release.<br/><br/>
When migrating to Magento 2.4 merchants will need to uninstall the extension distributed on the Marketplace (`paypal/module-braintree` or `gene/module-braintree`) and update any code customizations to use the `PayPal_Braintree` namespace instead of `Magento_Braintree`. Configuration settings from the core Magento Braintree Payments bundled extension and the extension distributed on the Magento Marketplace will be persisted and payments placed with those versions of the extension can still be captured, voided, or refunded as normal.<br /><br />
If you are upgrading to Magento 2.4.0 and were not using the recommended Magento Marketplace extension in your previous 2.3.x version, the multi address feature will not work with the 2.4.0 version of Braintree. When a shopper selects the _deliver to multiple addresses_ option, the Braintree payment method will not appear. Be aware that the Magento Marketplace Extension previously recommended for 2.3.x has this multiple address issue.
