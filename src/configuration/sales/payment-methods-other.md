Many popular payment integrations have moved to Magento Marketplace. Don't worry if your favorite payment method is removed in Magento 2.4.x. You can find the latest official payment integration extensions in [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions/payments-security/payment-integration.html?_ga=2.80488020.2105547619.1564067043-238341041.1564067043#q=&idx=m2_cloud_prod_default_products&p=0&hFR%5Bcategories.level0%5D%5B0%5D=Extensions%20%2F%2F%2F%20Payments%20%26%20Security%20%2F%2F%2F%20Payment%20Integration&nR%5Bvisibility_catalog%5D%5B%3D%5D%5B0%5D=1){:target="_blank"}.<br/><br/>
