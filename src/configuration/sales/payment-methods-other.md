Many popular payment integrations have moved to Commerce Marketplace. Don't worry if your favorite payment method is removed in Commerce 2.4.x. You can find the latest official payment integration extensions in [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions/payments-security/payment-integration.html?_ga=2.80488020.2105547619.1564067043-238341041.1564067043#q=&idx=m2_cloud_prod_default_products&p=0&hFR%5Bcategories.level0%5D%5B0%5D=Extensions%20%2F%2F%2F%20Payments%20%26%20Security%20%2F%2F%2F%20Payment%20Integration&nR%5Bvisibility_catalog%5D%5B%3D%5D%5B0%5D=1){:target="_blank"}.<br/><br/>
