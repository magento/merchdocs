## Product editions

Adobe offers two Magento editions to fit the requirements of your eCommerce business. The information in this User Guide is designed to accommodate business users from either edition, with notations for features and functions that are specific to one edition or an extended feature set.

- {:.ce-only}**Magento Open Source** is a self-hosted eCommerce platform with essential commerce features available free of charge. It offers you a stable and customizable solution for your growing small business or as a tool to prototype new ideas and business models for larger merchants.

- {:.ee-only}**Magento Commerce** an enterprise-grade eCommerce platform that provides a richer set of out-of-the-box features, with an unlimited ability to customize and seamless third-party integrations. Robust and scalable, Magento Commerce offers you a stable, secure, and customizable solution for your growing business. Magento Commerce includes one of our cloud infrastructure options as well as 24/7 customer support. It is designed to allow you to sell multiple brands, geographies, currencies as well as to both B2C and B2B buyers from a single platform.

### B2B features

- {:.b2b-only}The B2B module extends all of the features of Magento Commerce to meet the needs of companies who sell directly to other companies, rather than to consumers.
