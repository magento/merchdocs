## Product editions

Adobe offers two Commerce editions to fit the requirements of your eCommerce business. The information in this User Guide is designed to accommodate business users from either edition, with notations for features and functions that are specific to one edition or an extended feature set.

- {:.ce-only}**Magento Open Source** is a self-hosted eCommerce platform with essential commerce features available free of charge. It offers you a stable and customizable solution for your growing small business or as a tool to prototype new ideas and business models for larger merchants.

- {:.ee-only}**Adobe Commerce** is an enterprise-level eCommerce platform that provides a richer set of out-of-the-box features, with an unlimited ability to customize and seamlessly integrate with third-party providers. Robust and scalable, Adobe Commerce offers you a stable, secure, and customizable solution for your growing business. Adobe Commerce includes one of our cloud infrastructure options as well as 24/7 customer support. It is designed to allow you to sell multiple brands, geographies, currencies as well as to both B2C and B2B buyers from a single platform. For a list of the advanced capabilities included with Adobe Commerce, see [Commerce features](https://devdocs.magento.com/release/commerce-features.html) in our developer documentation.

### B2B features

- {:.b2b-only}The B2B module extends all of the features of Adobe Commerce to meet the needs of companies who sell directly to other companies, rather than to consumers. It combines the convenience of business-to-consumer commerce with advanced account management, robust inventory control, negotiated pricing, bulk order management, and more.

### PWA Studio

- {:.pwa-only}PWA Studio is a toolkit to create PWA storefronts for your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source backends. The toolkit gives you React components to build your UI and GraphQL APIs to access your data. Get more information at [PWA Studio](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/).
