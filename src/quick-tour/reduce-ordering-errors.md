Streamlined Order Process
:  [Quick Order]({% link sales/quick-order.md %}) reduces the process to several clicks. Commerce offers multiple ways to configure the [shopping cart]({% link sales/cart-configuration.md %}) and [checkout process]({% link sales/checkout-process.md %}), to eliminate manual data entry and reduce costly ordering errors.

Assisted Sales
:  Assign a [dedicated sales rep]({% link sales/shopping-assistance.md %}) to each company account. The assigned sales rep can access the customer’s shopping cart in real time and offer personal assistance over the phone.

Complete Inventory Visibility
:  Add [Order Management][1]{:target="_blank"} for complete inventory visibility with accurate, real-time inventory levels from all locations and supply chain partners. Drop-ship scheduled deliveries, and track inventory across multiple warehouse locations.

SKU and Inventory Validation
:  Commerce reduces ordering errors by automatically [verifying the SKU and availability]({% link sales/point-of-purchase.md %}) of all items before an order is submitted. Merchants can set the [out of stock threshold]({% link catalog/inventory-configure-inventory-management.md %}) for each product, set backorder levels, and manage the messaging that appears in the storefront.

Custom Catalogs and Price Lists
: Maintain different “shared” [catalogs with custom pricing]({% link catalog/catalog-shared.md %}) for specific companies.

Bulk Orders
:  Create bulk pricing tiers with per-unit costs and discounts according to order size. Buyers can [reorder]({% link customers/account-dashboard-my-orders.md %}) from previous orders or upload order data directly to the shopping cart.
