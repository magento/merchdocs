Magento makes it easy for you to get repeat business and build brand loyalty. Magento gives you total control and flexibility over creating and revising goodies like rewards programs, custom coupons and automated emails to keep your customers coming back again and again.

Email Marketing Automation
:  Send professionally designed, dynamic [email campaigns]({% link marketing/dotdigital/engagement-cloud.md %}) with live data from your Magento store, powered by [dotdigital][1].

<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
Merchandise Return
:  Customers can submit requests for [Return Merchandise Authorization]({% link sales/returns.md %}) from your store. You can create shipment orders in a carrier system and print shipping labels with RMA numbers.

Store Credit
:  Keep customers loyal and happy by issuing refunds as [store credit]({% link sales/store-credit-using.md %}) or virtual gift cards to ensure that the money they spend stays in your store.

Reward Points
:  Drive customer engagement with [reward programs and points]({% link marketing/rewards-loyalty.md %}) based on a range of transactions and customer behaviors. Base redemption on a variety of factors, such as balance, customer history, and conversion rates.

Target Shopping History
:  Encourage customers to make return purchases with targeted promotions based on their shopping history. With Magento Commerce, you can easily [build segments]({% link marketing/customer-segments.md %}) based on your customer base.

Custom Coupons
:  [Create coupons codes]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart-coupon.md %}) for social media, email, or print campaigns. You can incorporate coupon codes into any design you like.

Newsletters
:  Stay in touch with current customers who’ve opted to receive [newsletters]({% link marketing/newsletters.md %}). You can create as many newsletter templates as you want.

RSS Feed
:  When [RSS feeds]({% link marketing/rss-feed.md %}) are enabled, subscribers of each feed automatically receive alerts about any additions to products, specials, categories, and coupons. A link to all RSS feeds that you publish is provided in the footer of your store.
