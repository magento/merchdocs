Friction-Free Purchasing
:  Magento's self-service model makes it easy to build loyalty for fast, [friction-free purchasing]({% link customers/account-dashboard.md %}).

Fast Reordering
:  Customers can create new orders based on [previous orders]({% link customers/account-dashboard-my-orders.md %}) from the convenience of their customer account.

Order by SKU
:  Customers can add individual products to their cart [by SKU]({% link sales/order-by-sku.md %}) and quantity or import a list of products from a file.

Request a Quote
:  Authorized company buyers can initiate a price negotiation by [requesting a quote]({% link sales/quote-request.md %}) from the shopping cart.

Punch Out Solutions
:  Establish new customers with third-party solutions, such as [Punch Out Catalogs][2] and [PunchOut2Go][3]. You can find these solutions on the [Magento Marketplace][1]{:target="_blank"}.
