Checkout consists of two steps:

1. Shipping Information

   The first step of the checkout process is for the customer to complete the shipping address information, and to choose the shipping method. If the customer has an account, the shipping address is entered automatically, but can be changed if needed.

1. Review and Payment Information

   The second step of the checkout process is for the customer to choose the payment method and optionally apply a  discount code.

   Although Commerce allows configuring multiple coupon codes, a customer may apply only one coupon code to the cart. (See the [Coupon Codes]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart-coupon.md %}) for more information.)

   _Checkout page (Review & Payments)_

The progress bar at the top of the page follows each step of the checkout process, and the Order Summary shows the information entered up to this point.

The exception to a two-step checkout applies to virtual and/or downloadable products---if there are only these types of products in the shopping cart, checkout is automatically transformed to one-step procedure, because shipping information is not required.
