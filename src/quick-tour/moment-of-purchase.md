Now that youâ€™ve given your customer an engaging shopping experience, make it easy for them to complete their purchases. Magento is designed to help you streamline your checkout process experience while boosting conversion rates.

Instant Purchase

Shopping Assistance
:  [Assisted shopping]({% link sales/shopping-assistance.md %}) makes it easy for customer service reps to create orders for customers. In Magento Commerce, customer service reps have access to shopping cart contents, and can move items from a wish list to a shopping cart, apply coupon codes, and more.

Security
:  Whether an order is fulfilled online or over the phone, Magento provides [sophisticated security]({% link stores/security.md %}), including [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-captcha.md %}) and SSL encryption, with best-in-breed encryption and hashing algorithms to protect the security of the system.

Order Processing

Multiple Payment Options
:  Magento supports the [payment methods]({% link payment/payments.md %}) and currencies needed for global commerce. You can choose the ones you want to offer, and your customers can choose the ones they prefer at checkout.

PayPal Merchant Solutions
:  It is easy to integrate a [PayPal Payments]({% link payment/paypal.md %}) account to provide your customers faster, more secure checkout options.

Shipping Labels
:  Merchants have complete control over package characteristics such as weight and size. [Shipping labels]({% link shipping/shipping-labels.md %}), rate, and bar code information originates directly from the carrier. You can easily generate labels for a single order or for multiple orders.
