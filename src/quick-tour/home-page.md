Did you know that most people spend only a few seconds on a page before they decide to stay or go somewhere else? Thatâ€™s not long to make an impression! Studies show that people also love photographs, especially of other people. Whatever design you choose, everything on your home page should move visitors along toward the next step in the sales process. The idea is to guide their attention in a cohesive flow from one point of interest to the next.
