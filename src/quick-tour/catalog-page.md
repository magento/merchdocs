title: Catalog Page
---

Catalog page listings typically have small product images and brief descriptions, and can be formatted as a list or as a grid. You can add banners, videos, and keyword-rich descriptions, and also create special designs for a promotion or season. You might create a special category to feature a lifestyle or brand that is a curated collection of products from different categories.

The initial product description usually gives shoppers just enough information to merit a closer look. People who know what they want can add the product to their carts and go. Customers who shop while logged in to their accounts enjoy a personalized shopping experience.
