title: Shopping Cart

The cart is where order total can be determined, along with discount coupons and estimated shipping and tax, and a great place to display your trust badges and seals. This is  also an ideal opportunity to offer one last item. As a cross-sell, you can select certain items to be offered as an impulse purchase whenever a specific item appears in the cart.
