Did you know that people who use search are nearly twice as likely to make a purchase as those who rely on navigation alone? You might consider these shoppers to be _pre-qualified_.

With [Live Search]({% link live-search/overview.md %}) for Adobe Commerce, your store delivers a lightning fast, super-relevant, and intuitive search experience, and is available for Adobe Commerce at no additional charge.

With [standard catalog search]({% link catalog/search.md %}), your store includes a Search box in the upper-right corner, and a link to Advanced Search in the footer. All of the search terms that shoppers submit are saved, so you can see exactly what they’re looking for. You can offer suggestions, and enter synonyms and common misspellings. Then, display a specific page when a search term is entered.
