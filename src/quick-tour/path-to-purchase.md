Home Page
:  Your [home page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quick-tour/home-page.md %}) is like the front window display of your store. As the primary landing page, its design entices visitors to come inside for a closer look.

Catalog Page
:  The [Catalog page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quick-tour/catalog-page.md %}) shows products from your catalog in either a list or grid format. Customers can make selections based on a category they choose from the main menu, by using the layered navigation on the left or from the results of a search. They can examine the item in more detail or place it directly into the shopping cart.

Search Results
:  Did you know that people who use [search]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quick-tour/search-results.md %}) are nearly twice as likely to make a purchase as those who rely on navigation alone? You might consider these shoppers to be _pre-qualified_.

Product Page
:  The [product page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quick-tour/product-page.md %}) provides detailed information about a specific item in your catalog. Customers can read reviews, add the product to their wish lists, compare it to other products, share the link with friends, and most importantly, place the item into their shopping carts.

Shopping Cart
:  The [shopping cart]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link quick-tour/shopping-cart.md %}) lists each item by price and quantity selected, and calculates the subtotal. Shoppers can apply discount coupons, and generate an estimate of shipping and tax charges.
