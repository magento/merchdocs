Google Shopping ads Channel will be deactivated and removed from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) on April 28, 2020. We apologize for any disruption this may cause.

To minimize the impact of transitioning out of the Google Shopping ads Channel extension, we recommend two alternatives.

- Migrate your catalog and Google Campaigns directly to Google Merchant Center and Google Ads.

- Visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) to find a new extension that meets your needs.

What to expect next:

- On March 19, 2020, the extension will be removed from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).
- On April 28, 2020, the Google Shopping ads Channel extension will be deactivated in all Magento versions.

## Common Questions

1. What is happening?

    The Google Shopping ads Channel extension will be deactivated in all Magento versions. The extension will stop working, and if accessed in the Magento Admin from a previous install, a `Google Shopping ads has been disabled.` message appears. The extension will no longer sync product or ad campaign data with Google.

    Also, the extension will be removed from the Magento Marketplace as well as from any future Magento releases.

1. When is this happening?

    Google Shopping ads Channel will be removed from the Magento Marketplace on March 19, 2020 and deactivated in Magento on April 28, 2020. Before that date, we encourage users of the extension to visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) and search for "Google Shopping" to find an alternative extension.

1. What happens in the Magento Admin when the extension is deactivated?

    The extension will stop sending product feed data to Google Merchant Center and stop syncing Smart Shopping Campaigns with Google ads.

    Merchants who have the extension installed may still see Google Shopping ads in the Magento Admin, but when clicked, a `Google Shopping ads has been disabled.` message appears. Also, future Magento updates will no longer automatically install the extension.

1. What will happen to my existing Smart Shopping Campaigns?

    Google Smart Shopping campaigns set up using the Google Shopping ads extension will continue to run as they were initially set up. You can manage these campaigns directly from your Google ads dashboard at any time.

1. How can I migrate my existing Google Merchant Center account elsewhere?

    We recommend you explore the following two options:

    - Update product feed data directly from your Google Merchant Center account. See the [Google Onboarding Guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7439058?hl=en).

    - Visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) to find a Google product feed extension that meets your needs.

1. What will happen to the catalog I am currently syncing back to GMC?

    The catalog feed synced with the extension will stop updating in Google Merchant Center on April 28, 2020. For more information about setting up a new product feed, see the [Google Onboarding Guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7439058?hl=en).

1. What actions and when do I need to take prior to the disable date to minimize any disruption?

    We recommend you start exploring alternative extensions on the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) immediately. This will give you the most time to identify an alternative and begin migrating your information.
