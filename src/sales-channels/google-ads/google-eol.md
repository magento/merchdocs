Google Shopping ads Channel will be disabled and removed from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) on April 28, 2020. We apologize for any disruption this may cause.  

To minimize the impact of transitioning out of the Google Shopping ads Channel extension, we recommend two possible alternatives.

- Migrate your catalog and Google Campaigns directly to Google Merchant Center and Google Ads.
- Visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) to find the best alternative extension that meets your specific needs.  

What to expect next:

- On XXXXX, the extension will be removed from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).
- On April 28, 2020, the Google Shopping ads Channel extension will be disabled for all Magento versions.

## Common Questions

1. What does disabling Google Shopping ads mean?

    The Google Shopping ads Channel extension will be disabled from all Magento versions. The extension will stop working, and if accessed in the Magento Admin from a previous install, a `Google Shopping ads has been disabled.` message appears. Magento no longer with sync product and campaign data with Google.

    Also, the extension will be removed from the Magento Marketplace as well as from any future Magento releases.

1. When is this happening?

    Google Shopping ads Channel will be disabled and removed from the Magento Marketplace on April 28, 2020. Before that date, we encourage users of the extension to visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) and search for "Google Shopping" to find an alternative extension.

1. What happens in the Magento Admin when the extension is disabled?

    Customers who have the extension installed may still see Google Shopping ads in the Magento Admin, but when clicked, a `Google Shopping ads has been disabled.` message appears. Also, future Magento updates will no longer automatically install the extension.

1. What will happen to my existing Smart Shopping Campaigns?

    Google shopping campaigns set up using the Google Shopping ads extension are set to run for 30 days. Your campaigns could remain active for up to 30 days after the extension is disabled, depending on the setup or last renewal date. You won't be able to change or renew your campaign in Magento after your current 30-day period expires.

1. What can I expect to see on my end on that date?

    If you upgrade to Magento 2.3.5+, the extension is no longer automatically installed. Merchants who have the extension installed with previous Magento versions may still see Google Shopping ads in their Magento Admin, but when clicked, a `Google Shopping ads Channel has been disabled` message will appear.  Your Magento catalog will also no longer sync with your Google Merchant Center account.

1. Can I migrate my existing SSC elsewhere?

    We recommend you explore the following two options:

    - Migrate your catalog and Google Campaigns directly to Google Merchant Center and Google Ads.

    - Visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) to find the best alternative extension that meets your needs.

1. What will happen to the catalog I am currently synching back to my Google Merchant Center account? Will I lose all that info?

    _Ryan Please provide an answer. Question to you, what is already syncing, can they somehow keep in their GMC so they do not start back from scratch?_

1. What actions and when do I need to take prior to disable date to minimize any disruption?

    We recommend you start exploring alternative extensions on the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) immediately. This will give you the most time to identify and begin migrating your information to the new extension.


The following two questions are for our CSM (internal) team only. This should allow them to have a conversation with those customers who decide to call to ask about this.

1. Why is this happening?

   When we first launched this feature, our goal was to simplify your ad management, help you expand your reach, and leverage Google's powerful Smart Shopping Campaigns for you to win in the marketplace. Unfortunately, our extension did not deliver the intended added value. As you may have been aware, existing Google Ads customers were not able to onboard or use this extension without first having to close their existing Google account and open a new one during the onboarding process. This additional step and the time required is a hurdle for our merchants. This complexity led us to make the difficult decision to discontinue the extension.
