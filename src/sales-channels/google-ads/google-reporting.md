As your ads run, Google tracks all clicked ads links through to converted sales. Aggregated totals provide quick insight to your sales to determine the effectiveness of your ads, attractive products and prices, and costs per ad. Google Shopping ads Channel provides two options for reviewing your Smart Shopping campaigns through the Magento Admin or [Magento Business Intelligence](https://magento.com/products/business-intelligence).

## Magento Reporting

When accessing Google Shopping ads Channel, the dashboard provides aggregated reporting at the account level for the past 14 days (not including the current day). At a glance, learn more about the following:

* Calculated aggregated reporting of all costs and sales collected for your Google Ads Smart Shopping campaigns
* Campaign details and status for the entire run of the campaign
* Action options to modify and manage your campaigns
