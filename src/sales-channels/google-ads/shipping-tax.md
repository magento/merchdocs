**Step 3 of 4** for [GMCÂ Account Creation]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/gmc-acct-create.md %}).

To provide the best estimate of taxes, shipping, and grand totals for your customers, select the closest matching amounts for shipping and tax costs. Due to the complexity of shipping and taxes, you may want to enter shipping or tax settings through the Google Merchant Center (GMC). Your GMC account has extensive options to help you find the right calculations needed for your store. You must complete onboarding then configure values in your GMC account before Google approves your products.

These settings affect the displayed costs in your Google ads. As customers review ads, Google auto-detects their location, matches ads for them, and displays the calculated costs of product price, shipping, and tax. For example, searching for shoes and hovering over these sneakers, we see the seller provides free shipping and no taxes.

We recommend overestimating amounts if you cannot provide an exact match for costs. Google performs routine checks for merchant listed taxes and shipping costs, verifying the amounts best match actual calculations from your storefront. If the Google defined amounts are lower than your actual costs, Google may disapprove of the products and/or account.

## To set your shipping and tax rates:

1. Select and set a flat rate or configure in Google to Set your shipping cost:

    - To assign a flat shipping rate for all your products, select *Use a flat rate for all orders* and enter an amount per country listed. To set free shipping, select this option and enter 0 for the flat rate.
    - To configure your shipping costs in Google Merchant Center, select *I will set this up on Google Merchant Center*.

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    If you select this option and your country's required shipping costs, you may receive an account error until you configure this setting in Google Merchant Center.

1. Select and set configurations to **Set your tax cost**:

    - If you are operating inside of the United States, select **Use auto tax estimation (U.S. Only)**. If you only sell and ship to some states in the US, select the states where you operate from the list or by entering the name. Google provides estimated taxes based on the address of customers and your configurations. For details, see Google's [Set up tax settings (US only)][1].
    - If you are operating out of a country that uses VAT, or have no nexus in the United States, select **Don't configure tax/VAT is included in my product price**.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Next</span>.
