Your account may be disapproved or suspended due to breaking the Google [Terms of Service][1] and policies on [Prohibited Content][2]. The following instructions and information help you review and resolve your account issues. Some of the issues that can cause disapprovals may include product issues. When you open an error, the issue displays with additional information and a link to Google policies and instructions. Review the information then complete edits and actions to resolve those issues through the Magento Admin.

Review Google's [Understanding account suspension][3], [best practices]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/google-best-practices.md %}), and [troubleshooting][4] for additional information.

After onboarding completes, we check for product approval and account status with Google every 30 minutes for the first 72 hours of your integration. Google may require up to 10 days to complete reviews. After the first 72 hours, Magento checks product and account status once every 24 hours.
