Maintaining and running your campaigns may require editing settings such as targeted products and allocated daily budgets. Before making changes, be advised that Smart Shopping Campaigns have a learning period of two weeks for the Google AI to optimize performance of your ads. Every time you edit and modify a campaign's budget or assigned products, Google requires another two week re-learning period. If you have submitted product data for the first time or significantly updated existing data in your GMCÂ account, Google may take up to two business days to review the new data. As a result, products in your campaigns may take time to also update.

Depending on conversions and seasons, you may also want to pause or end campaigns to run others, without constantly editing the same campaigns. All campaigns require manual actions to pause, enable (or run), and end. You can create many campaigns to prepare for different seasons and promotions, pausing them until ready to cycle the campaigns.

See the following sections to manage and update your campaigns.
