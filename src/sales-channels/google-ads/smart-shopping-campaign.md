title: Creating a Google Smart Shopping Campaign
---


The process for creating a Google Smart Shopping campaign begins with a series of three onboarding steps:

[Google Ads Terms of Service]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales-channels/google-ads/gmc-service-terms.md %})

[Account Settings]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link sales-channels/google-ads/account-settings.md %})

To begin the Google Ads Channel onboarding process, on the **Google Advertising** dashboard, click **Create Ad Campaign**.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link images/images/sales-channels/google/google-ads-dashboard.png %}){: .zoom}
