Simplify your Google promotions and ad campaign management by integrating your Magento catalog with Google through Magento's Google Shopping ads Channel. This extension syncs your Magento product catalog and other information with your Google Merchant Center (GMC) and Ads accounts to promote and sell products. When you have integrated your Magento catalog, you can manage your GMCÂ catalog and publish Google Smart Shopping ads campaigns directly from Magento.

This guide provides insights to Google accounts, onboarding, managing your catalog, and developing campaigns. See the following sections to install, onboard, and start selling with Google.
