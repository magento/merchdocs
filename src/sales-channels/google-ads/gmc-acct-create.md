**Step 2 of 3** for [Google Shopping ads Channel onboarding]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/onboarding-google.md %}).

With your Magento web and Google accounts linked, you can create a Google Merchant Center (GMC) account and complete configurations for your products. See the [best practices]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/google-best-practices.md %}) for onboarding tips.

{% include gmc-domains.md %}

**Wait, I have claimed my URL with another GMC account!** If your storefront URL is already verified and claimed by another GMC account, you must [unclaim]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/gmc-unlink-gmc.md %}) any URL that is already claimed for another GMC account before continuing with account creation.

When creating your account, you will do the following:

![]({% link images/images/sales-channels/google/gmc-acct1.png %})

Your progress through the onboarding process will not complete until you click **Complete Setup**. We recommend completing all of these instructions to fully save your configurations, create your GMC account, and send the URL to Google to start URL claiming and verification.
