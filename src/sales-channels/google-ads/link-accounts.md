**Step 1 of 3** for [Google Shopping ads Channel onboarding]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/onboarding-google.md %}).

You must link your Magento web account and your Google account. To accomplish this, you'll need your login credentials for the Magento web account that you used to get your API Key and the login credentials for your Google account.

If you see a message requiring a Google APIÂ Key, see [Verifying the Google API Key]({% link sales-channels/google-ads/verify-api-key.md %}).

Your [Google account][1] is a general or business specific account for adding Google services and additional account for Merchant Center and Ads.

- If you already have a Google account, you'll need the login credentials to complete this linking process.

- If you don't have a Google account, go to [accounts.google.com][2] and click **Create account**. Follow the prompts to create a new Google account. Make note of your login credentials. When your Google account setup is complete, you can sign in to Google and complete this linking process.

We recommend using (or creating) a Google account that is associated to your business or company. This Google account is the primary owner (admin) of the Google Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts you set up in this integration with Google Shopping ads Channel. The payment methods you set up in your Google account will be used to complete purchases for Google Ads services.
