Listings that display on this tab include your existing Amazon listings that have not been matched to a product in your Magento catalog. To utilize listing management for quantity, pricing, handling time, and more, each of your Amazon listings must be assigned (matched) to a product in your Magento catalog. You have a few options to assign a listing to a product in your Magento catalog.

In the **Actions** drop-down:

{% include amazon-create-new-catalog-product-s-action.md %}

{% include amazon-attempt-auto-match-action.md %}

In the **Select** drop-down:

{% include amazon-assign-catalog-product-action.md %}

{% include amazon-create-new-catalog-product-action.md %}

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}

If you have listings in process, a message will be displayed above the tabs indicating how many.
