title: About Amazon Sales Channel
---

Amazon Sales Channel is a powerful extension that seamlessly integrates your Magento Admin with your Amazon Seller Central account. Once integrated, Magento becomes a "central command center" for managing listings, monitoring orders and inventory, and controlling pricing for your Amazon store.

The integration connects Magento and Amazon to sync data between both platforms. Amazon Sales Channel enables you to:

- [Onboard]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-onboarding-home.md %}) and integrate one or more Amazon Seller Central accounts with Magento.

- Import and sync your existing Amazon listings into your Magento catalog.

- Create and manage Amazon listings for your Magento catalog products.

- Review and fulfill (ship) orders in Magento and Amazon, syncing order status and refunds.

- Review logs for analysis and errors for [competitive prices]({% link sales-channels/amazon/store-reports.md %}), [listing changes]({% link sales-channels/amazon/listing-changes-log.md %}), and [communication issues]({% link sales-channels/amazon/communication-errors-log.md %}).

Manage and review all of these features, account information, listings, orders, and more on the [Amazon Sales Channel Home]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-sales-channel-home.md %}) central dashboard.
