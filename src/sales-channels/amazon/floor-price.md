title: 'Intelligent Repricing Rule: Floor Price'
---


Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- [Select Rule Type]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})
- [Competitor Conditional Variances]({% link sales-channels/amazon/competitor-conditional-variances.md %})
- [Price Adjustment]({% link sales-channels/amazon/price-adjustment.md %})
- **Floor Price**
- [Optional Ceiling Price]({% link sales-channels/amazon/optional-ceiling-price.md %})

The automated limit settings are used to help protect the floor pricing against the intelligent pricing rules. This allows the store owner to set a floor for their intelligent pricing rules with the ease of mind that the automated rules will not price their Amazon listing below a desired price.

Floor price attributes will work off the website scope if your Magento store is using website pricing scope. For more information, see [Price Scope]({% link sales-channels/amazon/price-scope.md %}).

Floor price is only used with [intelligent repricing rules]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %}).

## To configure the Floor Price section of an Intelligent Repricing Rule Price action:

{% include amazon-intelligent-pricing-floor-price-configure.md %}

In this example, the floor price is set to be 3% above the cost of the item.
