If you are managing a store that is in "Active" or "Inactive" status, see [Price Rule Conditions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/pricing-rule-conditions.md %}).

Conditions determine which products will be eligible for the price rule. Defining the conditions for your Amazon pricing rules follow the same logic and process as defining the conditions for [Cart Price Rules]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}) in Magento.

**If your price rule applies to all products in your Magento catalog, then leave this section blank.**

{% include amazon-price-rule-condition.md %}

When complete with your price conditions, continue to the [Pricing Rule Actions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-pricing-rules-actions.md %}) section.
