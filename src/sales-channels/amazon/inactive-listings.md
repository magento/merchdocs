Listings that display on this tab include your products that have been published to Amazon but are not active on the Amazon marketplace. Your listings could be inactive for a few different reasons. For example, you might not be eligible to list that particular brand. Inactive listings are dictated by Amazon's listing standards and your Amazon Seller Central account permissions.
