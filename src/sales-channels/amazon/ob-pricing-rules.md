If you are managing a store that is in "Active" or "Inactive" status, see [Pricing Rules]({% link sales-channels/amazon/pricing-products.md %}).

Price rules are initially defined during onboarding, but can be modified at any time after your store setup is complete. You can access the price rules for a store during setup in the [Amazon Stores]({% link sales-channels/amazon/managing-stores.md %}) tab in Amazon Sales Channel Home. Click the store's name in the store list to display the store's onboarding progress. Click **Pricing Rules** in the progress bar.

There are two types of pricing rules:

- [Standard Pricing Rule]({% link sales-channels/amazon/standard-price-rules.md %})
- [Intelligent Repricing Rule]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})
