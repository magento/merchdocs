If you are managing a store that is in "In Setup" status, see [Onboarding: Price Rule Conditions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-pricing-rules-conditions.md %}).

Conditions determine which products will be eligible for the price rule. Defining the conditions for your Amazon pricing rules follow the same logic and process as defining the conditions for [Cart Price Rules]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}) in Magento.

**If your price rule applies to all products in your Magento catalog, then leave this section blank.**

Any areas in the conditions that are bold can be clicked to see the various options.
