Once you continue to the **Listing Preview** (step 4), you cannot change the website selected in your listing rules (step 3) for this integration. To change the website after leaving step 3, you must exit this [store integration]({% link sales-channels/amazon/store-integration.md %}) and begin a new one.

At this step of onboarding, you have created your listing rules that determine which of your Magento catalog products are eligible to be listed on Amazon.

{% include amazon-listing-preview.md %}

See [Listing Preview]({% link sales-channels/amazon/listing-rule-preview.md %}) for column descriptions.
