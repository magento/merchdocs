Store Review is the final step of the onboarding process. At this stage of onboarding, Magento has connected to Amazon, requested your listing information, and compared your Amazon listings to your listing settings, rules, overrides, and conditions. All listings are categorized based on these settings.

## To complete your Store Review and Complete your Setup:

1. See the table below for all listing descriptions and options.

1. Review your listings on their appropriate tabs.

1. Update listing status by modifying your configurations and listing rules. You have a couple methods for updating listings:
    - Use the actions available on each tab for your listings to review and edit your listings.
    - Edit your store's listing settings through previous Onboarding steps.

1. When you are satisfied with your listings, click <span class="btn">Complete Setup</span>.
<br/>You can edit these settings at any time after completing onboarding setup. Access the store integration through the [Amazon Sales Channel Home]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-sales-channel-home.md %}).

Your Amazon Sales Channel store setup completes, your listing information is published to your Amazon Seller Central account, and the status of the new store changes "Active" on the Amazon Sales Channel Home screen.

In this final step, you need to review each of your listings and modify as needed to ensure your listings are published as you want. Each tab displays based on their status according to your current settings. If you want to update a listing, match it to your Magento catalog, to change its publish status, you can use the available actions on each screen as described below.

When your listings display in the status you wish and you are complete with adjusting your store, listing, and rules settings, you are ready to click **Complete Setup**. Your store setup will complete, your listings and data will transmit and publish to Amazon. After setup, you can manage your stores, listings, and orders from the [Amazon Sales Channel Home]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-sales-channel-home.md %}) screen.

The different tabs on the Store Review screen allow you to review your Amazon listings before completing your Amazon Sales Channel store setup.

### Store Review Tabs

|Tab|Description|
|---|---|
|Incomplete|Displays your Magento catalog products that meet your defined listing settings but are missing information required by Amazon for a listing. |
|New Third Party|Displays your existing Amazon listings (based on information received from Amazon) that are not matched to a product in your Magento catalog. |
|Ready to List|Displays your catalog products that are ready to create new Amazon listings, but your store is not configured to automatically publish new listings. This tab is used to manually publish your new listings. |
|Inactive|Displays your catalog products that have been published to Amazon, but Amazon has not approved the listing for Active status. |
|Active|Displays your Amazon listings that have been matched to a product in your Magento catalog, have been published to Amazon, and Amazon has approved for Active status. |
|Overrides|Displays your Amazon listings that meet the criteria for a defined override and to which the override has been applied. Overrides take priority over any other account setting. |
|Ineligible|Displays your existing Amazon listings that are no longer eligible, based on your defined [listing settings]({% link sales-channels/amazon/ob-listing-settings.md %}). |
|Ended|Displays your Amazon listings that have manually been ended (removed) from Amazon. |

Each tab differs slightly in the options available in the **Actions** drop-down, the **Select** (Action column) drop-down, and the default and available table columns. The [workspace controls]({% link sales-channels/amazon/workspace-controls.md %}) are the same and allow you to customize displayed data.

The **Actions** drop-down options can apply the selected action to all listings selected (checked), while options in the **Select** drop-down in the **Action** column applies the action only to the individual listing.
