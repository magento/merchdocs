Listing settings are initially defined during onboarding, but can be modified at any time after your store setup is complete. You can access the listing settings for an Active or Inactive store in the [store's dashboard]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}). In the **I Want To...** section, click **Listing Settings**. The Listing Settings screen displays with the Product Listing Actions section expanded by default.

## To configure listing settings:

1. Expand each section to review and configure listing settings. Complete all required fields to continue.
    - [Product Listing Actions]({% link sales-channels/amazon/product-listing-actions.md %}): Defines if eligible Magento products automatically publish to Amazon and the default handling time for shipments (2 is default).
    - [Third Party Listings]({% link sales-channels/amazon/third-party-listing-settings.md %}): Defines if Amazon Seller Account product listings should be imported into your Magento catalog.
    - [Listing Price]({% link sales-channels/amazon/listing-price.md %}): Cap Magento pricing attributes and configure pricing settings.
    - [(B2B) Business Price]({% link sales-channels/amazon/business-pricing.md %}): Define your tiered-pricing settings when selling to another business.
    - [Stock / Quantity]({% link sales-channels/amazon/stock-quantity.md %}): Configure your stock management thresholds for inventory management.
    - [Fulfilled By]({% link sales-channels/amazon/fulfilled-by.md %})\: Define who fulfills orders.
    - [Catalog Search]({% link sales-channels/amazon/catalog-search.md %}): Configure your search parameters to ensure a reliable process for matching your Magento catalog products with your Amazon product listings.
    - [Product Listing Condition]({% link sales-channels/amazon/product-listing-condition.md %}): Configure your settings and values for product "condition." Condition is a product detail that is required by Amazon, but is not required for your Magento catalog products.
