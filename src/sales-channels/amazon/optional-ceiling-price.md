title: 'Intelligent Repricing Rule: Optional Ceiling Price'
---


Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- [Select Rule Type]({% link sales-channels/amazon/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})
- [Competitor Conditional Variances]({% link sales-channels/amazon/competitor-conditional-variances.md %})
- [Price Adjustment]({% link sales-channels/amazon/price-adjustment.md %})
- [Floor Price]({% link sales-channels/amazon/floor-price.md %})
- **Optional Ceiling Price**

The automated limit settings are used to help protect the ceiling pricing against the intelligent pricing rules. This allows the store owner to set a high-price-limit for their intelligent pricing rules.

## To configure the Optional Ceiling Price section of an Intelligent Repricing Rule Price action:

{% include amazon-intelligent-pricing-ceiling-configure.md %}

In this example, the ceiling price is set to be 2% below the MSRP of the item.
