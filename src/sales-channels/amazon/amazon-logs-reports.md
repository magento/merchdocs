Amazon Sales Channel includes some valuable logs and reports that allow you to view the changes that are affecting your Amazon listings and orders. You can use these reports to see what is happening in your store and to understand various listing statuses.

No actions are available for the logs or reports, as they are review-only features.

The following logs apply to Amazon Sales Channel and are not store specific. These logs can be accessed from [Amazon Sales Chanel Home]({% link sales-channels/amazon/amazon-sales-channel-home.md %}).

- The [Listing Changes Log]({% link sales-channels/amazon/listing-changes-log.md %}) displays the changes that have occurred in your Amazon Seller Account as a reflection of your Amazon Sales Channel settings.

- The [Communication Errors Log]({% link sales-channels/amazon/communication-errors-log.md %}) displays any reported communication errors with Amazon.
