If you are managing a store that is in "Active" or "Inactive" status, see [Listing Settings]({% link sales-channels/amazon/listing-settings.md %}).

Listing settings are initially defined during onboarding, but can be modified at any time after your store setup is complete. You can access the listing settings for a store during setup in the [Amazon Stores]({% link sales-channels/amazon/managing-stores.md %}) tab in Amazon Sales Channel Home. Click the store's name in the store list to display the store's onboarding progress. Click **Listing Settings** in the progress bar.
