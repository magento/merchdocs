title: Edit an Assigned ASIN
---

You can edit the Amazon ASIN value assigned to a product in your Magento catalog. This is a helpful feature if a catalog product was improperly matched to one of your Amazon listings. Changing the assigned ASIN for the listing does not change the ASIN assigned to a product by Amazon. It only changes the Amazon listing to which your catalog product is matched.

When an assigned ASIN is changed:

- Magento ends your Amazon listings attached to the old ASIN
- Validates the ASIN with Amazon
- Creates a new listing for the updated ASIN
- Updates listing information in Amazon Sales Channel

## Edit an assigned ASIN

1. View the listing on the _Product Listings_ page (_Inactive_, _Active_, or _Ineligible_ tab).

1. Under _Actions_, click **Edit Assigned ASIN**.

   This opens the _Product Listing Update_ page.

1. For **Assign ASIN**, enter the new ASIN value.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Listing Update</span> to save your changes.
