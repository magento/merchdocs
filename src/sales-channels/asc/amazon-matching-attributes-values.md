title: View Amazon Attribute Mapping
---


As you map Amazon attributes to Magento attributes, Amazon Sales Channel tracks and provides a filterable list of all Amazon values. Use this page to verify values for your linked Magento attributes correctly sync between Magento and Amazon. You can review synced values for Amazon attribute linked or not linked to a Magento attribute. To create or edit your Amazon attributes, see [Creating and Editing Attributes]({% link sales-channels/asc/creating-attributes.md %}).

The Amazon Value differs depending on the attribute type and the Amazon attribute you view. For example, a listed Amazon value for `Label` would be a text value while `AmazonListPrice` would be a numerical amount. The status indicates if the Amazon value has been imported.

## View your attribute values

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Channels_ > **Amazon**.

1. Click **Attributes** in the left-side menu, locate an Amazon attribute, and click either **Create** or **Edit** in the _Action_ column.

1. Click the **Matching Attribute Values** tab.

    Listings that have a corresponding Magento catalog product will show a linked value in the _Magento Product SKU_ column. Clicking a link will open the corresponding catalog product detail page. Changes to Amazon attributes on the product detail page do not sync back to Amazon Sales Channel.
