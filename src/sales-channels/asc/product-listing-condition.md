Product Listing Condition settings are part of your store listing settings. You can access the listing settings on the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

Amazon requires a product listing to have a defined condition. If all your products are the same condition, you can select one of the Amazon condition options to represent all of your products as your global condition value. Standard Amazon conditions include:

- New
- Refurbished
- Used; Like New
- Used; Very Good
- Used; Good
- Used; Acceptable
- Collectible; Like New
- Collectible; Very Good
- Collectible; Good
- Collectible; Acceptable

However, if your catalog contains products in different conditions (New, Used, Refurbished, etc.), you must choose **Assign Condition Using Product Attribute**. This setting allows you to map your Magento condition attribute and values to your Amazon listing's conditions.

During [Pre-Setup Tasks]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-pre-setup-tasks.md %}), you are encouraged to create a Magento product attribute for a product's condition. If you offer products in various conditions and you have not created a condition attribute, see [Create a product attribute in Magento]({% link sales-channels/asc/ob-creating-magento-attributes.md %}). Once the condition attribute is created, you can assign a condition value to each of your products in your Magento catalog.

## Configure Product Listing Condition settings

1. Click **Listing Settings** on the store dashboard.

1. Expand the _Product Listing Condition_ section.

1. For **Listing Product Condition**, choose an option.

    Choose one of the standard Amazon conditions to use as your global condition value for all of your listings. Default setting is `New`.

    If you have products/listings that have different conditions, choose `Assign Condition Using Product Attribute` to define your product condition settings in the additional fields that appear.

1. For **Condition Attribute**, choose the Magento attribute to map values for each of the standard Amazon condition attributes.

   If you have products that fall in the `Used` or `Collectible` condition but you do not distinguish further (Like New, Very Good, Good, or Acceptable), you can map to a single `Used` or `Collectible` Amazon condition and leave the other `Used` or `Collectible` conditions blank. This will map all of your `Used` or `Collectible` conditions to the single Amazon Used or Collectible condition.

   For example, you have a single `Used` condition for your products. When mapping, you will choose whether you want to map to the Amazon condition `Used; Like New`, `Used; Very Good`, `Used; Good`, or `Used; Acceptable`. Only complete the field for the Amazon condition you want, leaving the other `Used` options set to `--Select Option--`. You'll see in the example image, all of your Magento products in `Used` condition are mapped to the Amazon `Used; Very Good` condition.

   You can also enter descriptive text for your conditions, except `New`.

1. When complete, click **Save listing settings**.
