The Buy Box is awarded by Amazon to the seller who has the product listed usually at the best price, along with other factors such as FBA/Prime shipping offered, availability, and the seller's performance.

The _Buy Box Competitor Pricing_ tab  on the _Product Listing Details_ page includes the [Buy Box]({% link sales-channels/asc/buy-box-competitor-pricing.md %}) listing price, shipping price, and landed price of your competitors. This can be used to understand the price positioning of your competitors on Amazon.
