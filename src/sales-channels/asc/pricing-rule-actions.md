Price Rule Actions define the adjustment calculations that will be applied to the price source to determine the listing price.

## Standard Price Rule

A [standard price rule]({% link sales-channels/asc/standard-price-rules.md %}) allows you to increase or decrease an Amazon listing price by a specific percentage or fixed dollar amount relative to the Magento catalog price (or price source).
