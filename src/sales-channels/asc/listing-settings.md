Listing settings are accessed from the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

Listing settings define how your Commerce catalog products are listed on Amazon. Your listing settings consist of several categories that allow you to define the interactions and communication between Amazon Sales Channel and your respective Amazon Seller Central account.

When configuring your listing settings, you define your eligibility rules for your Commerce catalog products to automatically published to Amazon as new listings, set up your Amazon listing prices based on your Commerce catalog or on competitor pricing, define your fulfillment method, and more.

You should expand each of the sections and configure as needed.
