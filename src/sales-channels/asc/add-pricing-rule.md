Pricing rules can be configured or modified at any time after your store is integrated. Pricing rules are part of [Listing Settings]({% link sales-channels/asc/listing-settings.md %}) and can be accessed in the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

## Standard Price Rule
A standard price rule action allows you to increase or decrease an Amazon listing price by a specific percentage or fixed dollar amount relative to the **Magento Price Source** defined in your [Listing Price]({% link sales-channels/asc/listing-price.md %}).

## Intelligent Repricing Rule
An intelligent repricing rule uses Amazon competitors' pricing to determine your listing price. Competitors are other sellers that are listing the same products you are listing on Amazon.
