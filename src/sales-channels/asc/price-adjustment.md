title: Price Adjustment
---


{:.bs-callout-info}
The Price Adjustment section differs slightly for Standard and Intelligent repricing rules. **Match Competitor Price** is only available under _Price Action_ when **Rule Type** is set to `Intelligent repricing rule`.

Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- [Select Rule Type]({% link sales-channels/asc/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})
- [Competitor Conditional Variances]({% link sales-channels/asc/competitor-conditional-variances.md %})
- **Price Adjustment**
- [Floor Price]({% link sales-channels/asc/floor-price.md %})
- [Optional Ceiling Price]({% link sales-channels/asc/optional-ceiling-price.md %})

The price adjustment defines the price calculation once you have identified the competitor price source.

## Configure price adjustment
