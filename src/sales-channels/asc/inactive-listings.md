title: Inactive Listings
---


The _Inactive_ tab shows your products that have been published to Amazon but are not active on the Amazon marketplace. Your listings could be inactive for a few different reasons. For example, you might not be eligible to list that particular brand. Inactive listings are dictated by Amazon's listing standards and your Amazon Seller Central account permissions.

Under _Actions_:

{% include amazon-end-listing-s-action.md %}

{% include amazon-edit-listing-overrides-action.md %}

Under **Select** in the _Action_ column:

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}

{% include amazon-create-override-action.md %}

{% include amazon-edit-assigned-asin-action.md %}

{% include amazon-create-alias-sku-action.md %}

{% include amazon-switch-to-fulfillment-action.md %}

{% include amazon-end-lising-action.md %}
