title: Ready to List
---


The _Ready to List_ tab shows your Magento catalog products that meet your listing settings and are ready to publish to Amazon as a **new** listing. Unlike other listing tabs, this tab does not always appear on the [_Product Listings_]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-product-listings.md %}) page.

The _Ready to List_ tab appears only when [**Automatic List Action**]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-actions.md %}) in your listing settings is set to `Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products`. This setting tells Amazon Sales Channel that any new Amazon listings must be published manually.

When [**Automatic List Action**]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-actions.md %}) is set to `Automatically List Eligible Products`, Amazon Sales Channel automatically publishes new listings for your eligible catalog products. Because new listings are published automatically, the _Ready to List_ tab is not displayed.

Under _Actions_:

{% include amazon-publish-to-amazon-action.md %}

Under **Select** in the _Action_ column:

{% include amazon-publish-on-amazon-action.md %}

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}

You have a few options to manually [publish a new listing to Amazon]({% link sales-channels/asc/publish-listings-manually.md %}).

If you have listings in process, the number of listings will display in a message above the tabs.

### Common Causes of Ready to List Listings

- **Ready to List** - Product has been matched to an Amazon ASIN and is scheduled to be listed. If [**Automatic List Action**]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-actions.md %}) in your listing settings is set to `Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products`, the _Ready to List_ status represents the products which are ready to be manually listed.

- **List in Progress** - The product listing has been submitted to Amazon and is awaiting confirmation of acceptance from Amazon.
