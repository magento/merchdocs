The _Incomplete_ tab shows  your Magento catalog products that meet your Amazon eligibility requirements as defined in your [listing rules]({% link sales-channels/asc/listing-rules.md %}) but are missing information required by Amazon before listing (example: the Amazon ASIN or a defined product condition).

There are four possible causes for an incomplete listing, each identified by its status.

When incomplete listings are properly matched to your catalog products, the listing will move from the _Incomplete_ tab and will publish to Amazon based on your [_Product Listing Actions_]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-actions.md %}) settings.

The available actions on the _Incomplete_ tab include:

Under _Actions_:

{% include amazon-re-attempt-auto-match-action.md %}

Under **Select** in the _Action_ column:

{% include amazon-update-required-info-action.md %}

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}

If you have listings in process, the number of listings will appear in a message above the tabs.
