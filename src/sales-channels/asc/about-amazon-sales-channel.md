Amazon Sales Channel is a powerful extension that seamlessly integrates your Commerce Admin with your Amazon Seller Central account. After [onboarding]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-onboarding-home.md %}), Commerce becomes a "central command center" for managing and controlling your Amazon listings, orders and inventory, and pricing for your Amazon store.

[Store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}) connects your Commerce instance and Amazon to sync data between both platforms. Amazon Sales Channel enables you to:

- [Onboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-onboarding-home.md %}) and integrate one or more Amazon Seller Central accounts with Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source.

- Import and sync your existing Amazon listings and match to products in your Commerce catalog, creating a centralized product catalog.

- Create and manage Amazon listings for products in your Commerce catalog.

- View and fulfill (ship) orders in Commerce and Amazon, syncing order status, payment, and refund information.

- View logs for analysis and errors for [competitive prices]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-reports.md %}), [listing changes]({% link sales-channels/asc/listing-changes-log.md %}), and [communication issues]({% link sales-channels/asc/communication-errors-log.md %}).

Access your Amazon stores to view and manage all of these features, account information, listings, orders, and more on the [Amazon Sales Channel home]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-sales-channel-home.md %}) page.
