## With Order Import Enabled

After [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}), [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}#configure-order-settings) is `Enabled` by default. This means that corresponding Magento orders are created for your Amazon orders and can be managed in the [Magento Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) workflow.

Regardless of your order import settings, Amazon orders that existed in your Amazon Seller Central account prior to your [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}) will not import.

New orders created in Amazon will import into Magento, but not immediately. Amazon assigns a `Pending` status to new orders. After Amazon verifies the order and the payment method, the order status is changed to `Unshipped`. This status change by Amazon triggers the order import into Magento. When imported, the order information appears in the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard, and Magento creates a corresponding order.

Imported Amazon orders can be managed in the [Magento Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) and workflow, just like your other Magento stores. Click the Amazon order number shown in the _Order Number_ column to open the order in the [Magento order process]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}#order-view-descriptions).

## With Order Import Disabled

If you do not want to import and manage your your Amazon orders in Magento, you can change the [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}#configure-order-settings) setting to `Disabled`. This means that when new orders are received from Amazon, corresponding Magento orders are created.

When disabled, order information received from Amazon appears in the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard. This order information is view only, and you must manage these orders in Amazon Seller Central. Click the Amazon order number shown in the _Order Number_ column to open the order details in Amazon Seller Central.
