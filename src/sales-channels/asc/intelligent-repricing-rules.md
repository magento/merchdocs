title: 'Intelligent Repricing Rule: Select Rule Type'
---

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-warning}
Intelligent repricing rules do not function properly if the Amazon region is set to `Inactive` status, as it is during onboarding. Your pricing calculations depend on your shipping rates, and your region must be in `Active` status for your shipping rates to sync from Amazon.<br/><br/>To update your region status in your Amazon account, go to Settings > Account Info > Vacation Settings. Refer to [Amazon: Listing Status for Vacations](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=200135620&amp;language=en_MX&amp;ref=ag_200135620_cont_191).

An intelligent repricing rule uses Amazon competitors' pricing to determine your listing price. Competitors are other sellers who list the same products as yours on Amazon.

Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- **Select Rule Type**
- [Competitor Conditional Variances]({% link sales-channels/asc/competitor-conditional-variances.md %})
- [Price Adjustment]({% link sales-channels/asc/price-adjustment.md %})
- [Floor Price]({% link sales-channels/asc/floor-price.md %})
- [Optional Ceiling Price]({% link sales-channels/asc/optional-ceiling-price.md %})

## Configure the rule type

Define the Rule Type in the _Select Rule Type_ section.

1. For **Rule Type**, choose `Intelligent repricing rule`.

   This enables the _Competitor Price Source_ field and the [_Competitor Conditional Variances_]({% link sales-channels/asc/competitor-conditional-variances.md %}), [_Floor Price_]({% link sales-channels/asc/floor-price.md %}), and [_Optional Ceiling Price_]({% link sales-channels/asc/optional-ceiling-price.md %}) sections.

1. For **Competitor Price Source**, choose an option:

    - **Use "Buy Box" Price** - Choose when you want to adjust your Amazon pricing based on the Amazon [Buy Box]({% link sales-channels/asc/buy-box-competitor-pricing.md %}) seller price. A [Buy Box]({% link sales-channels/asc/buy-box-competitor-pricing.md %}) price exists when multiple sellers on Amazon offer the same product. Amazon defines the [Buy Box]({% link sales-channels/asc/buy-box-competitor-pricing.md %}) seller based on performance requirements. Merchants seek to win the [Buy Box]({% link sales-channels/asc/buy-box-competitor-pricing.md %}) seller status and offers maximum visibility of your product listings.

    - **Use Lowest Competitor Price** - Choose when you want to compare and adjust your listing price to competitor pricing for the same product. When chosen, the _Minimum Positive Feedback_ and _Minimum Feedback Count_ fields enable.

1. If enabled, choose an option for **Minimum Positive Feedback**.

    - **All Competitor's Prices** - Choose when you want to compare and adjust your pricing based on all competitor prices for the same product.

    - **Minimum 80/90/95/98% positive feedback** - Choose when you want to limit the competitors to whom the price is compared for the same product. This will narrow the competitors further by requiring their listing to have a minimum of the chosen percentage of positive feedback before applying the lowest price rule.

1. If enabled, enter a numerical value for **Minimum Feedback Count**.

   This is an optional numerical value that further narrows down the competitive pricing. For example, if a merchant has a 95% positive feedback rating, but only has a feedback count of `20`, this might not be a competitor you would want modify your pricing against. However, if you enter a value of `1000`, it would require that the merchant have 95% positive feedback and a minimum of 1000 merchant reviews.

You might use these competitor pricing and feedback options to avoid basing your pricing against a competitor who has poor feedback and is selling a lower quality product.
