The Listing Changes Log shows the changes that have occurred in your Amazon Seller Account as a reflection of your Amazon Sales Channel settings. This log indicates the global changes that have been synced between Amazon and Amazon Sales Channel. This log includes listing changes for a product SKU such as the type of action (change), brief description of the change, and the date of the change.

No actions are available for the log. It is a review-only feature.
