Product Listing settings can be modified at any time after your store is integrated. You can access your listing settings on the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

On the store dashboard, click **Manage Listings** in the _Store Listings_ section. The _Product Listings_ page opens to the _Active_ tab by default.

You can also click **Active Listings**, **Inactive Listings**, and **In Progress Listings** in the _Store Listings_ section to directly access those tabs.

**In Progress Listings** are either your _Ready to List_ listings or your _Incomplete Listings_, depending on your [_Product Listing Actions_]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-actions.md %}) settings.<br/>If **Automatic List Action** is set to:<br/>- `Do Not Automatically List Eligible Products`, the link opens your [_Ready to List_]({% link sales-channels/asc/ready-to-list.md %}) listings.<br/>- `Automatically List Eligible Products`, the link opens your [_Incomplete_]({% link sales-channels/asc/incomplete-listings.md %}) listings.
