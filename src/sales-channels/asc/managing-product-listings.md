Product Listing settings can be modified at any time after your Commerce store is integrated. You can access your listing settings on the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

To access your product listings by their listing status, click **Manage Listings** in the _Store Listings_ section. The [_Product Listings_]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-listings-by-tab.md %}) page opens to the _Active_ tab by default.

You can also click **Active Listings**, **Inactive Listings**, and **In Progress Listings** in the _Store Listings_ section to directly access those tabs.

**In Progress Listings** are either your _Ready to List_ listings or your _Incomplete Listings_, depending on your [_Product Listing Actions_]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-actions.md %}) settings. See the tab descriptions in [Manage Listings by Status / Tab]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-listings-by-tab.md %}).

See [Manage Listings by Status / Tab]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-listings-by-tab.md %}) and [Manage Listings by Action]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-listings-by-action.md %}).
