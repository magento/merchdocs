The Amazon Sales Channel for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source is a powerful, comprehensive extension that enables Commerce merchants to seamlessly sell products in the Amazon Marketplace, the world's largest global internet shopping destination. This extension enables Amazon sales by integrating Commerce with your Amazon Seller Central account and providing both automation and synchronization of catalog and order data. Completely manage all Amazon listings, implement simple or intelligent pricing rules, and maintain your orders and inventory through a single Commerce dashboard.

Getting started is easy. Complete a short onboarding process to create an Amazon Seller Central account and integrate with your Amazon Sales Channel store and your Commerce catalog to manage Amazon listings, orders, inventory, and fulfillment. A central dashboard shows status updates for all your Amazon Sales Channel store integrations and Amazon listings. Reach new customers in the global Amazon Marketplace with simplified and automated processes â€“ all at little or none of the cost and labor of setting up a new system.

After integrating your Amazon Seller Central account, Amazon Sales Channel enables you to manage your accounts and syncs data between Commerce and Amazon. Amazon Sales Channel enables you to create listings, manage promotions, set prices, and manage inventory and fulfillment directly through the Commerce Admin. These options include pricing rules that monitor Amazon pricing for the same item and automatically adjusts your prices to be more competitive.

This guide reviews some basic Amazon Seller Central information, the requirements for setting up your Amazon Sales Channel, the onboarding and integration process, the available store, product, price and other options, and the ways in which you can use Amazon Sales Channel to manage your listings and sales in the Amazon marketplace.
