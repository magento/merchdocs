Order Settings define if and how Amazon orders are imported into and processed in Commerce and can be accessed on the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

By default, your order import settings are set to `Enabled`. This means that your Amazon orders will show on the store dashboard and create corresponding Commerce orders. Imported orders can be managed in the Commerce [Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) workflow.

{:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
Regardless of your order settings, Amazon orders that existed prior to your store integration will not import.

After [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}) is complete, you can change your order settings. If you set your order settings to `Disabled`, Amazon orders show on the store dashboard but must be managed in your Amazon Seller Central account.

When an order is created on Amazon, it is not immediately imported into Commerce. Amazon assigns a `Pending` status to newly created orders. After Amazon verifies the order and payment method, the order's status is changed to `Unshipped`. This status change triggers the order import, and Commerce creates a matching, corresponding order.

Orders imported from Amazon can be managed in the Commerce [orders workflow]({% link sales/orders.md %}). See also [Manage Orders]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-orders.md %}).

## Configure order settings

1. Click **Order Settings** on the store dashboard.

1. For **Import Amazon Orders** (required), choose an option:

    - **Disabled** - Choose when you do not want to create corresponding orders in Commerce when new orders are received from Amazon. When chosen, all other fields on this page are disabled.

    - **Enabled** - (Default) Choose when you want to create corresponding Commerce orders when new orders are received from Amazon. Commerce orders are created based on Amazon status and stock levels.

    {:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
    Import Amazon Orders must be set to `Enabled` to manage Amazon orders in the Commerce [orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) workflow. When set to `Disabled`, your Amazon orders do not have a corresponding Commerce order number and cannot be managed in Commerce. You must manage these orders in your Amazon Seller Central account.

1. For **Import Amazon Orders Into Magento Store**, choose which Commerce store the Amazon orders will be associated with when the corresponding order is created in Commerce. This setting defaults to the Store View for the website selected when you [added the Amazon store]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}). If you want to change this setting, the list of options depends on the Commerce stores you have set up in your configuration. See [Stores]({% link stores/stores-all-create-view.md %}#create-a-new-store-view).

1. For **Customer Creation**, choose an option:

    - **No Customer Creation (guest)** - (Default) Choose when you do not want to create a customer account in Commerce using the imported customer data from the Amazon order. When chosen, Commerce processes an imported Amazon order the same way it processes a guest checkout in Commerce.

    - **Build New Customer Account** - Choose when you want to create a New Customer Account in Commerce using the customer data imported with the Amazon order. This builds your customer database from your Amazon orders.

1. For **Order Number Source**, choose an option:

    - **Build Using Magento Order Number** - (Default) Choose when you want to create a unique Commerce order number for the corresponding Amazon order using the Commerce incrementally-assigned order ID.

    - **Build Using Amazon Order Number** - Choose when you want to create the Commerce order number using the corresponding Amazon-assigned order number.

    {:.bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
    After an order is imported, the Amazon order number shows in the _Recent Orders_ list on the store dashboard. The Commerce order number shows when viewing the order details in the Commerce [Orders]({% link sales/orders.md %}) workspace.

1. For **Order Status** (required), choose an option:

    - **Default Order Status** - (Default) Choose when you want newly created orders imported from Amazon to be assigned your defined default order status for new orders. The default status for new orders (unless you have created a custom order status for new orders) is `Pending`. See [Processing Orders]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}).

    - **Custom Order Status** - Choose when you want newly created orders imported from Amazon to be assigned a status other than the default.

       - **Processing Order Status** - Enables when **Order Status** is set to `Custom Order Status`. Choose the status you want to use for newly created orders imported from Amazon. The options in this field are based on the default status options in Commerce. See [Order Status]({% link sales/order-status.md %}). You can also create a custom order status to show here for selection. To create a custom order status, see [Custom Order Status]({% link sales/order-status-custom.md %}).

1. When complete, click **Save order settings**.

{:.bs-callout-info}
If an Amazon order is imported in a `Partially Shipped` or `Shipped` status, the inventory reservation that is created will be for all items in the order. Amazon Sales Channel does not compensate for items that have been previously shipped.<br/>
<br/>If an order is Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) but an item is in `out of stock` status, Commerce is unable to create a corresponding order. This is a limitation of MSI integrations.
