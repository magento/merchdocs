The _New Third Party_ tab shows your existing Amazon listings that have not been matched to a product in your Magento catalog. To use listing management for quantity, pricing, handling time, and more, each of your Amazon listings must be matched (assigned) to a product in your Magento catalog. You have a few options to assign a listing to a product in your Magento catalog.

Under _Actions_:

{% include amazon-create-new-catalog-product-s-action.md %}

{% include amazon-attempt-auto-match-action.md %}

Under **Select**:

{% include amazon-assign-catalog-product-action.md %}

{% include amazon-create-new-catalog-product-action.md %}

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}

If you have listings in process, a message will appear above the tabs indicating the number of listings.
