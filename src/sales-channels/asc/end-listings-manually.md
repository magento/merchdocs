When ending a single listing or multiple listings, a message confirms that the selected listing is being processed to end. Ended listings can be managed on the [Ended]({% link sales-channels/asc/ended-listings.md %}) tab on the [_Product Listings_]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-product-listings.md %}) page. When processed and removed from Amazon, the status for the listing will change to `Manually Ended`. Ended listings will be removed from Amazon until you manually republish the listing using the [_Publish to Amazon_]({% link sales-channels/asc/publish-listings-manually.md %}) action.
