title: View Amazon Orders

There are 2 ways to view your Amazon orders, _Recent Orders_ and _All Orders_.

Both options show you basic order information, as received from Amazon, including:

- Purchase Date
- Order Number
- Status
- Buyer's Name
- Grand Total
- Order Notes

_All Orders_ view adds filtering options for order searches.

With the exception of the _Order Notes_ column, the _Amazon orders_ table is populated with order information as received from Amazon. The _Order Notes_ column is updated by Magento as the order processes.

## View recent Amazon orders

You can view your most recent orders in the _Recent Orders_ section of the [store dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

1. View your orders in the _Recent Orders_ section.

   Depending on your order import setting, the order details will open in Amazon or in the Magento order workflow.

## View all Amazon orders

You can view all of your Amazon orders on the _Amazon orders_ page (also referred to as the _All Orders_ view). The Amazon Orders table is similar to the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard, but allows you to view all of your Amazon orders and to narrow your orders list with the following filter options:

- Purchase Date (range)
- Order Number
- Buyer's Name
- Total (range)
- Status
