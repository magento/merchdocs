1. Click **OK** on the confirmation message.

    A confirmation message will display that the selected listing is being processed to publish to Amazon.

    Listing information is published to Amazon based on your cron settings. Listing information is sent to Amazon at the next data sync. Until Amazon replies with the listing confirmation, the manually published listing(s) remains on the _Ready to List_ tab with a `List in Progress` status. When the listing confirmation is received from Amazon, the listing(s) moves to the _Active_ tab with an `Active` status.
