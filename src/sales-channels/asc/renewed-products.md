Before you can list your high-quality, like-new products (refurbished, pre-owned, and open-box) on Amazon, you must first register and be approved for the [Amazon Renewed Program](https://sell.amazon.com/programs/renewed.html).

After you are approved and your Seller Central account is updated, you can manage your renewed listings in Amazon Sales Channel. Renewed listings require the following steps in Amazon Sales Channel:

- Define your _Refurbished_ settings in your Listing Settings > [Product Listing Condition]({% link sales-channels/asc/product-listing-condition.md %}).

- Include `Renewed` in the product title (required by Amazon).

Your renewed product listings that do not meet the requirements set by Amazon will change to `Inactive` status and move from the [Active Listings]({% link sales-channels/asc/active-listings.md %}) tab to the [Inactive Listings]({% link sales-channels/asc/inactive-listings.md %}) tab. Also, the [Listings Changes Log]({% link sales-channels/asc/listing-changes-log.md %}) will show a `Refurbished` error message.
