After integrating your store, review and configure the integration settings store through the Amazon Store Dashboard. These settings display for **Inactive** and **Active** stores. Here you can change the name of your Amazon store and the email address you associated with the store during store integration.

## Modify store integration settings

1. Click **View Store** on a store card to show the store [dashboard]({% link sales-channels/asc/amazon-store-dashboard.md %}).

1. Click **Store Integration Settings** in the left-side menu.

1. For **Email Address**, update your preferred contact email address.

1. For **New Store Name**, update the descriptive name for your new Amazon Sales Channel store. This name appears on the [_Amazon Stores_]({% link sales-channels/asc/managing-stores.md %}) tab.

    This name is used as a Commerce reference only and will identify the store in the list on the Amazon Sales Channel home page. You will want to make it something your team can easily identify. For example, your Amazon store that sells in the United States region might be named `Amazon Store USA`.

1. Click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

The _Amazon Marketplace Country_ setting defined during [store integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}) cannot be updated. To edit the country setting, you must delete the store (under _Action_ on the store card) and add a new store for the different country.
