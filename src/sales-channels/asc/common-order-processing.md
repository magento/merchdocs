[Commerce order processing]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}) can manage your Amazon orders, including emailing the buyer, fulfilling the order (shipping), issuing credits/refunds, adding comments, and more. To manage your Amazon orders, your [**Import Amazon Orders**]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}) setting must be set `Enabled` so that corresponding Commerce orders are created when Amazon orders are received. Amazon order information shows in the _Recent Orders_ section of the store dashboard.

When enabled, corresponding Commerce orders are created for Amazon orders, and the Amazon order number shows in the _Order Number_ column. If a corresponding Commerce order is created, click the order number to open the order in the Commerce [order processing]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}) page. You can manage the order as you do your other [Commerce order processing]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}).

The Commerce order number does not show with the _Recent Orders_ information. The Commerce order number only shows when you click the Order Number on the store dashboard and open the order in [Commerce order processing]({% link sales/order-processing.md %}). When viewing the Commerce order, the Amazon Order number appears in the _Payment & Shipping Method_ section, along with options to _View or Cancel Amazon Order_ and _View all Amazon Orders_, depending on the order's shipping status.

See [cancel an unshipped order]({% link sales-channels/asc/cancel-unshipped-order.md %}).
