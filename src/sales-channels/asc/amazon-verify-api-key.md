When accessing Amazon Sales Channel, Commerce automatically checks and validates the Amazon API key you have added in your store configuration. If validated, then you can move on to the next step, [Store Integration]({% link sales-channels/asc/store-integration.md %}).

If the Amazon API key is missing, invalid, or expired, you must update your key. A message appears prompting you to get an API key and to add they key to your Amazon Sales Channel configuration.

## Get and add the Amazon API key as prompted

The API key is validated each time you access your Amazon Sales Channel.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Channels_ > **Amazon Sales Channel**.

    If this is your first time accessing Amazon Sales Channel or if you need to update your API key, a modal will appear to prompt you through the process.
