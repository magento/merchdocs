## Example: Fulfilled by Merchant

|**Step** | **Description** |
|**1**| **A merchant-fulfilled order is placed on Amazon.** Amazon assigns a status of `Pending` until the customer's credit card information is verified. Orders in `Pending` status automatically import into Amazon Sales Channel but do not display on the _Orders_ tab.|
|**2**| **The order is verified by Amazon.** When verified, Amazon changes the status to `Unshipped`. With this status change, the order is updated in Amazon Sales Channel and appears in the _Orders_ tab.|
|**3**| **The order details are updated.** Amazon Sales Channel updates the order details with the price, customer email, and customer name. During this update, the Amazon order will create the corresponding Commerce order in the order management page. The Commerce order number will display with the order information on the _Orders_ tab.|
|**4**| **A new customer account is created.** If configured in your order settings and the customer does not exist in your Commerce database, a new customer is created in your Commerce database using the corresponding customer information from the Amazon order. If you chose `No Customer Creation (guest)` in your order settings, the order will follow the Commerce guest process and not create a new customer in your database. At this point, if your Commerce system is integrated with an ERP/OMS/WMS, the order will be picked up per the integration of a new order being placed and created inside Commerce.|
|**5**| **The order is shipped.** From the Commerce order processing page, you will ship the order and add a tracking number. When all items are marked in a `Shipped` status:<br/>- The status of the Commerce order will change to `Complete`.<br/>- The status of the Amazon Sales Channel order will change to `Shipped`.<br/>- The tracking number will be synced to Amazon, and the status of the order in Amazon will change to `Shipped`.<br/>- Shipping notifications will be sent to the customer via Amazon, not from Commerce (per Amazonâ€™s policies).|

## Example: Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)

|**Step** | **Description** |
|**1**| **An Amazon-fulfilled order is placed on Amazon.** |
|**2**| **The order is imported.** The order is not imported into Amazon Sales Channel until the order is assigned the `Shipped` status by Amazon. Since Amazon has the inventory for this product, this prevents interference with your warehouse/inventory management. |
|**3**| **The order details are updated.** If configured in your [order settings]({% link sales-channels/asc/order-settings.md %}), the Amazon order will create the corresponding Commerce order and be created as an order with a status of `Complete`. |
