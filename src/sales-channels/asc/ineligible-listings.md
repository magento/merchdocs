title: Ineligible Listings
---


The _Ineligible_ tab shows a list of all the products that are currently published on Amazon but are not eligible as a listing based on your current listing rules. If a previous product was eligible and the listing rules are modified making some products ineligible, the quantity associated with a product drops to 0 and the product is marked as ineligible but will still be present on your Amazon Seller Account.

To move a product out of the _Ineligible_ tab, you may need to [modify your listing rules]({% link sales-channels/asc/listing-rules.md %}) to allow your products to be eligible.

The available actions on the _Ineligible_ tab include:

Under _Actions_:

{% include amazon-end-listing-s-action.md %}

{% include amazon-edit-listing-overrides-action.md %}

Under **Select** in the _Action_ column:

{% include amazon-view-details-action.md %}

{% include amazon-create-override-action.md %}

{% include amazon-edit-assigned-asin-action.md %}

{% include amazon-create-alias-sku-action.md %}

{% include amazon-switch-to-fulfillment-action.md %}

{% include amazon-end-lising-action.md %}

If you have listings in process, the number of listings will display in a message above the tabs.
