title: 'Intelligent Repricing Rule: Floor Price'
---


Sections of an intelligent repricing rule include:

- [Select Rule Type]({% link sales-channels/asc/intelligent-repricing-rules.md %})
- [Competitor Conditional Variances]({% link sales-channels/asc/competitor-conditional-variances.md %})
- [Price Adjustment]({% link sales-channels/asc/price-adjustment.md %})
- **Floor Price**
- [Optional Ceiling Price]({% link sales-channels/asc/optional-ceiling-price.md %})

The [floor price]({% link sales-channels/asc/floor-price.md %}) settings automatically protect your lowest product price against the intelligent pricing rules. This allows the store owner to set a floor (lowest price) for their intelligent pricing rules. This means that your products will not be listed below a desired price.

Floor price attributes are based on the website scope if your Magento store is using website pricing scope. See [Price Scope]({% link sales-channels/asc/price-scope.md %}).

Floor price is only used when **Rule Type** is set to `Intelligent repricing rule`.

## Configure floor price

Define your lowest price setting in the _Floor Price_ section.

1. For **Floor Price Source**, choose an price source attribute.

   Choose the Magento [product attribute]({% link catalog/product-attributes.md %}) that indicates your relative floor limit. For example, if you do not want your Amazon listing price to go below the cost of your item, you would choose the _Cost_ attribute.

1. For **Floor Price Action**, choose an option.

    - **Decrease By** - Choose when you want the defined _Floor Price Source_ value to be adjusted down, creating a lower floor price for the rule, before listing to Amazon.

    - **Increase By** - Choose when you want the defined _Floor Price Source_ value to be adjusted up, creating a higher floor price for the rule, before listing to Amazon.

    - **Match** - Choose when you do not want the listing price to fluctuate below the defined _Floor Price Source_ value. When set to `Match`, the _Apply_ and _Floor Adjustment Amount_ fields are disabled.

1. **Apply** defaults to `Apply as percentage`.

1. For **Floor Adjustment Price**, enter the numerical value for the percent to adjust your _Floor Price Source_ value.

In this example, the floor price is set to be 3% above the cost of the item.
