Google Shopping ads Channel was disabled on April 28, 2020. We apologize for any disruption this may cause.

To minimize the impact of transitioning out of the Google Shopping ads Channel extension, we recommended two alternatives.

- Migrate your catalog and Google Campaigns directly to Google Merchant Center and Google Ads.

- Visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) to find a new extension that meets your needs.

What to expect next:

- On March 19, 2020, the extension was removed from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).
- On April 28, 2020, the Google Shopping ads Channel extension was disabled in all Magento versions.

## Common Questions

1. What happened?

    The Google Shopping ads Channel extension was disabled in all Magento versions. The extension stopped working, and if accessed in the Magento Admin from a previous install, a `Google Shopping ads has been disabled.` message appears. The extension no longer syncs product or ad campaign data with Google.

    Also, the extension is removed from the Magento Marketplace and disabled in any future Magento releases.

1. When did this happen?

    Google Shopping ads Channel was removed from the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) on March 19, 2020 and disabled in Magento on April 28, 2020. We encourage merchants to visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) and search for "Google Shopping" to find an alternative extension.

1. What happened in the Magento Admin when the extension was deactivated?

    The extension stopped sending product feed data to Google Merchant Center and stopped syncing Smart Shopping Campaigns with Google ads.

    Merchants who have the extension installed may still see Google Shopping ads in the Magento Admin, but when clicked, a `Google Shopping ads has been disabled.` message appears.

1. What happened to my existing Smart Shopping Campaigns?

    Google Smart Shopping campaigns set up using the Google Shopping ads extension continued to run as they were initially set up. Merchants can manage these campaigns directly from the Google ads dashboard at any time.

1. How can I migrate my existing Google Merchant Center account elsewhere?

   We recommend that merchants explore the following two options:

   - Update product feed data directly from the Google Merchant Center account. See the [Google Onboarding Guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7439058?hl=en).

   - Visit the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/) to find an alternative Google product feed extension.

1. What happened to the catalog I was syncing back to GMC?

    The catalog feed synced with the extension stopped updating in Google Merchant Center on April 28, 2020. For more information about setting up a new product feed, see the [Google Onboarding Guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/7439058?hl=en).

1. What actions should I take now?

    If you have not already done so, we recommend you explore alternative extensions on the [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/).
