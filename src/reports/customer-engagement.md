## Available Reports

* **Importer Status**: Tracks the status of batched data syncs from Engement Cloud to Magento: batch ID, important type (contact, catalog, etc), mode (bulk), status (processing, imported, etc), any messaging, and date time stamp when initiated.
* **Automation Enrollment**: Tracks the status of automations you created in Engagement Cloud such as programs, triggered campaign content, and the default auto responder. The report helps you locate automations with failures to update settings, etc.
* **Campaign Sends**: Tracks the status of emails sent as part of your campaigns, indicating if the emails queue for sending, if sent to Engagement Cloud, and if any emails are failing to send. These emails include abandoned cart and review request emails.
* **SMS Sends**: Tracks all dotdigital Transactional SMS notifications: type (order confirmations/updates,shipment updates, credit memos), phone (number of the customer that the SMS notification was sent to), customer email, content of the SMS, status (delivered, pending, or failed), and date of creation and sending.
* **Cron Tasks**: Tracks all cron tasks managed and run by Engagement Cloud. Cron jobs manage and run all syncs, initiating data batches.
* **Log Viewer**: Provides log entries generated by Engagement Cloud, tracking all data syncs. Logs are available on your Magento instance (`var/logs/`).
* **Abandoned Carts**: Tracks entries generated by abandoned cart configurations, programs, etc.

## Required: Sync settings for reporting

Prior to configuring reporting options, you should complete [Enagagement Cloud configuration]({% link configuration/dotdigital/accounts.md -%}) and [enable syncs]({% link configuration/dotdigital/sync-settings.md -%}).

For Syncs, most integrations set the following to "yes": Customer Enabled, Guest Enabled, Subscriber Enabled, and Order Enabled. This shares and syncs dotdigital data with the Magento integration. Data is synced in batches to Magento.

## Configure Single Sign-on (OAUTH) Credentials

To directly link your Engagement Cloud and Magento accounts without requiring a login step (using single sign-on), enter your authorization credentials in the Magento Admin. This allows you to access and create campaigns, automation programs, manage contacts, etc all from one application.

1. Click **Reports** in the Admin. Under _Customer Engagement_, select **Dashboard**.
1. Expand *OAUTH Credentials*.
1. Enter the **Client Id** and **Client Secret Key**, provided by dotdigital.
1. If your Engagement Cloud is running on a custom domain (not the Engagement Cloud domain), for **Custom OAUTH Domain**, enter the domain URL ending in a `/`.
1. If your Admin site is running on a different domain than your website, for **Custom Authorization URI**, enter the full website URL ending in a `/`.
1. Click <span class="btn">Connect</span> to test the credentials. If sauccessful, the button displays as "Disconnect". It must be connected to authorize.

## Restrict IP Access

To add a layer of security for external dynamic content, you can manage the  list of requesting IP addresses that these URLs will display for when requested from them.

By default, the integration includes three IP addresses Engagement Cloud sends requests from when sending emails to pull in this content. During testing, you may want to include your company's IP address to the list.

If you leave this field empty, a security check does not run. We do not recommend leaving this blank.
