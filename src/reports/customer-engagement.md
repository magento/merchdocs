* **Automation Enrollment**: Tracks the status of automations you created in Engagement Cloud such as programs, triggered campaign content, and the default auto responder. The report helps you locate automations with failures to update settings, etc.

* **Cron Tasks**: Tracks all cron tasks managed and run by Engagement Cloud. Cron jobs manage and run all syncs, initiating data batches.

* **Abandoned Carts**: Tracks entries generated by abandoned cart configurations, programs, etc.

## Required: Sync settings for reporting

Prior to configuring reporting options, you should complete [Enagagement Cloud configuration]({% link configuration/dotdigital/accounts.md -%}) and [enable syncs]({% link configuration/dotdigital/sync-settings.md -%}).

For Syncs, most integrations set the following to "yes": Customer Enabled, Guest Enabled, Subscriber Enabled, and Order Enabled. This shares and syncs dotdigital data with the Commerce integration. Data is synced in batches to Commerce.

## Configure Single Sign-on (OAUTH) Credentials

To directly link your Engagement Cloud and Commerce accounts without requiring a login step (using single sign-on), enter your authorization credentials in the Admin. This allows you to access and create campaigns, automation programs, manage contacts, etc all from one application.

1. Expand *OAUTH Credentials*.
1. Enter the **Client Id** and **Client Secret Key**, provided by dotdigital.

## Restrict IP Access

To add a layer of security for external dynamic content, you can manage the  list of requesting IP addresses that these URLs will display for when requested from them.

By default, the integration includes three IP addresses Engagement Cloud sends requests from when sending emails to pull in this content. During testing, you may want to include your company's IP address to the list.

If you leave this field empty, a security check does not run. We do not recommend leaving this blank.
