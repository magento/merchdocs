title: New Relic Reporting

---

[New Relic][1] is a software analytics service that helps you analyze and improve application interactions. Magento Commerce Cloud accounts include the software for the New Relic APM service. For more information, see [New Relic services][4]{:target="_blank"} in our developer documentation.

## Step 1: Sign Up for a New Relic Account

1. Go to the [New Relic][1] website and sign up for an account.

   You can also sign up for a [free trial account][2].

1. Follow the instructions on the site. When prompted choose the product that you want to install first.

1. While you are in your account, locate the following credentials that you will need to complete the configuration:

    | Account ID | From your New Relic account dashboard, the Account ID is the number in the URL after: `/accounts` |
    | Application ID | From your New Relic account dashboard, click **New Relic APM**. In the menu, choose **Applications**. Then, choose your application. The Application ID is the number in the URL after: `/applications/` |
    | New Relic API Key | From your New Relic account dashboard, click **Account Settings**. In the menu on the left under Integrations, choose **Data Sharing**. You can create, regenerate, or delete your API key from this page. |
    | Insights API Key | From your New Relic account dashboard, click **Insights**. In the menu on the left under Administration, choose **API Keys**. Your Insights API Key(s) appear on this page. If necessary, click the plus sign (**+**) next to Insert Keys to generate a key. |

## Step 2: Install the New Relic Agent on Your Server

To use New Relic APM Pro to gather and transmit data, the PHP agent must be installed on your server.

1. When prompted to choose a web agent, click **PHP**.

1. Follow the instructions to set up the PHP agent on your server.

   If you need help, see [New Relic for PHP][3].

1. Make sure that cron is running on your server.

   To learn more, see [Configure and run cron][5] in our developer documentation.

## Step 3: Configure Your Store

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel where **General** is expanded, choose **New Relic Reporting** and do the following:

    ![]({% link images/images/config-general-new-relic-reporting-general.png %}){: .zoom}
    [_New Relic Reporting_]({% link configuration/general/new-relic-reporting.md %})

    * Set **Enable New Relic Integration** to `Yes`.

    * In the **Insights API URL**, replace the percent (%) symbol with your New Relic Account ID.

    * Enter your **New Relic Account ID**.

    * Enter your **New Relic Application ID**.

    * Enter your **New Relic API Key**.

    * Enter you **Insights API Key**.

1. In the **New Relic Application Name** field, enter a name to identify the configuration for internal reference.

1. (Optional) For the **Send Adminhtml and Frontend as Separate Apps** field, select `Yes` to send collected data for the storefront and Admin as separate apps to New Relic.

   This option requires a name entered for the **New Relic Application Name**.

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    Enabling this feature reduces the number of false positive New Relic alerts and allows for configured monitoring and alerts strictly for frontend performance. New Relic receives separate app data files with names of Application Name appended to Adminhtml and frontend. For example: MyStore_Adminhtml

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

## Step 4: Enable Cron for New Relic Reporting

1. Expand ![]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}){: .Inline} the **Cron** section.

    ![]({% link images/images/config-general-new-relic-reporting-cron.png %}){: .zoom}
    [_Cron_]({% link configuration/general/new-relic-reporting.md %})

1. Set **Enable Cron** to `Yes`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
