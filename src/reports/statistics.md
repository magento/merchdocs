To reduce the performance impact of generating sales reports, Magento calculates and stores the required statistics for each report. Rather than recalculate the statistics every time a report is generated, the stored statistics are used, unless you refresh the statistics. To include the most recent data, the report statistics must be refreshed before a sales report is generated.
