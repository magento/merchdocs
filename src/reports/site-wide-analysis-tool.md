The Site-Wide Analysis Tool provides 24/7 real-time performance monitoring, reports, and recommendations to ensure the security and operability for installations of Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure. The Site-Wide Analysis Tool provides a dashboard and reports with system insights and recommendations based on best practices that you can use to address detected issues. The service is available in [production mode]({% link magento/installation-modes.md %}) for Admin users with permission to access user [role resources]({% link system/permissions-user-roles.md %}).

## Step 1: Verify permissions

Verify that the Admin user account has permission to access the Site-Wide Analysis Tool through their [assigned user role]({% link system/permissions-user-roles.md %}).

{:.bs-callout-warning}
The Site-Wide Analysis Tool role resource (permission) is **not** auto-assigned. It MUST be activated for the user role and the role individually assigned to each user account in the Admin.

For the custom role needing Site-Wide Analysis Tool access, do the following:

1. Select the **Reports** > _System Insights_ > **Site-Wide Analysis Tool** role resource.

   ![Select the Site-Wide Analysis Tool permission]({% link images/images-ee/reports-swat-role-access.png %}){: width="330px"}<br/>
   _Site-Wide Analysis Tool permission selected for the role_

1. Click <span class="btn">Save Role</span>.

1. Notify any users who are assigned that role to sign out of the Admin, and sign in again.

{:.bs-callout-info}
If you have verified that the user account has permission to access the Site-Wide Analysis Tool and the user receives a 403 error when trying to access the tool from the Admin, your instance of Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure could have HTTP access control enabled. The Site-Wide Analysis Tool Dashboard is NOT supported if you have HTTP Auth enabled. For more information about resolving this issue, see our [Support article](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057400172-403-errors-when-accessing-Site-Wide-Analysis-Tool-on-Magento).
