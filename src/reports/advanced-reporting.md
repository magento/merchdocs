title: Advanced Reporting
---

Advanced Reporting, which is included with Magento Commerce and Open Source customers, gives you access to a suite of dynamic reports that are based on your product, order, and customer data, with a personalized dashboard that is tailored to your business needs. While Advanced Reporting uses Magento Business Intelligence (MBI) for analytics, you do not need to have an MBI account to use Advanced Reporting.

For technical information, see [Advanced Reporting][2]{:target="_blank"} in our developer documentation.

## Requirements

* The website must run on a public web server.

* The domain must have a valid security (SSL) certificate.

* Magento must have been installed or upgraded successfully without error.

* In the Magento configuration for [store URLs]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}), the **Base URL (Secure)** setting for the store view must point to the secure URL. For example https://yourdomain.com.

* In the Magento configuration for [store URLs]({% link stores/store-urls.md %}), **Use Secure URLs on Storefront** and **Use Secure URLs in Admin** must be set to `Yes`.

* Make sure that [Magento crontab][3]{:target="_blank"} is created and cron jobs are running on the installed server.

Advanced Reporting can be used only with Magento installations that have continually used a single [base currency]({% link stores/currency-configuration.md %}).

## Step 1: Enable Advanced Reporting

In the Magento configuration, [Advanced Reporting]({% link configuration/general/advanced-reporting.md %}) is enabled by default, and starts automatically if cron is [configured]({% link configuration/advanced/system.md %}) and running. An attempt to establish the subscription is initiated at the beginning of each hour over the next 24-hours until successful. The subscription status is “pending” until the subscription is successfully established.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel where **General** is expanded, choose **Advanced Reporting** and do the following:

   * Verify that **Advanced Reporting Service** is set to `Enable`. (This is the default setting.)

   * Set the **Time of day to send data** to the hour, minute, and second, according to a 24-hour clock, that you want the service to receive updated data from your store. By default, data is sent at 2:00 AM.

   * Under **Industry Data**, choose the **Industry** that best describes your business.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

1. When prompted, click the [Cache Management]({% link system/cache-management.md %}) in the message at the top of the page. Then, refresh any invalid caches.

1. Wait overnight, or until after the time of your next scheduled update. Then, check the status of your subscription. If the status is still _pending_, make sure that your installation meets all of the requirements.

## Step 2: Access Advanced Reporting

1. Do one of the following:

   * On the _Admin_ sidebar, choose **Dashboard**. Then, click <span class="btn">Go to Advanced Reporting</span>.
   * On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Reports** > _Business Intelligence_ > **Advanced Reporting**.

   The Advanced Reporting dashboard provides a quick summary of your orders, customers, and products. Make sure to scroll down to see the full dashboard.

1. To get a better view of the data, set the **Filters** in the upper-right corner to the time period and store view that you want to include in the report. Then, do the following:

   * Hover over any data point for more information.
   * Click each tab to see all dashboard reports.

## Troubleshooting

If you get a 404 “Page Not Found” message, verify that your store meets the requirements for Advanced Reporting. Then, follow the instructions to verify that the integration is installed.

### Verify that the Integration is Active

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **System** > _Extensions_ > **Integration**.

1. Verify that the **Magento Analytics user** integration appears in the list and the **Status** is `Active`.

1. To reestablish the user, click **Reauthorize** and do the following:

   ![]({% link images/images/advanced-reporting-integration-reauthorize.png %}){: .zoom}
   *Reauthorize*

   * When prompted, click <span class="btn">Reauthorize</span> to approve access to the API resources.

   * Verify that the list of Integration Tokens for Extensions is complete. Then, click <span class="btn">Done</span>.

      *Integration Tokens*

1. Look for the message that indicates the integration “Magento Analytics user” is reauthorized.

1. Wait overnight, or until after the time of your next scheduled update.

### Verify Single Base Currency

Advanced Reporting can be used only with Magento installations that have used only a single [base currency]({% link stores/currency-configuration.md %}) since the time of installation. The result is that in the history, all orders use the same base currency. Advanced Reporting will not work if you have, at any time, changed your base currency and have orders in your history that were processed with different base currencies.
