With B2B for Adobe Commerce, your store can support company accounts to simplify the corporate shopping experience by enabling companies to create multiple subaccounts with flexible permissions based on user roles in their organization. Depending on the customer groups of the company, a store administrator can adjust promotions and prices to suit their needs, and create highly customized offers that cater to the shoppers' demands and increase orders. For more information about  these features, see the [B2B for Adobe Commerce User Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/companies/account-companies.html).
