<!--{% if "Default.B2B Only" contains site.edition %}-->
For Magento Commerce for B2B, the Company component is the key entity within B2B on which all other features are in some way dependent. It allows joining multiple buyers that belong to the same company into a single company account (or corporate account). You can configure [Company Accounts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link customers/account-companies.md %}) in your store to allow customers to set up and maintain their own company hierarchy of teams, with different levels of user permissions.
