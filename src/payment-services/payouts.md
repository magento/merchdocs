The Payouts report shows comprehensive payout information at-a-glance, allowing you full transparency into the payment amount, processed volume, and detailed reporting on the transaction level for financial reconciliation.

You don't have to open multiple dashboards or views to cross-reference orders and payments or reconcile accounts. Payment Services for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source enables you to take all these actions from one place---Payouts report---so that you can view and manage your payouts efficiently.

See linked Magento order and transaction IDs, transaction amounts, payment method per transaction, and more, all within the Payouts report in the Admin.

You can download payout transactions in a .csv file format for use in existing accounting or order management software.

The data shown in this table is sorted in descending order (`DESC`) by default using the `TRANS DATE`. The `TRANS DATE` is the date and time when the transaction was initiated.

_Data sources selection_

If _Live_ is the selected data source, you will see report information for your live store(s). If _Sandbox_ is the selected data source, you will see report information for your Sandbox environment.

Data source selections work as follows:

* If you do not have any stores that are in Live mode, the data source selection defaults to _Sandbox_.
* If you have any stores (one or multiple) in Live mode, the data source selection defaults to _Live_.
* Report exports always honor the data source selection.

To select the data source for your Order Payment Status report:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > **Payment Services** > **Payouts**.
1. Click the **Data source** dropdown.
1. Select _Live_ or _Sandbox_.
