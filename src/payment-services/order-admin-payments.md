title: Create an order with Payment Services
---

You can customize Payment Services to your needs with helpful configuration options in the Admin.

Payment services for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source offer registered customers who need assistance, the ability to fulfill an order directly from the Admin. The **Create New Order** form includes all the information that is needed to complete the normal checkout process, including hosted fields with credit card information. See [Creating an order]({% link customers/customer-account-create-order.md %}) for detailed information about the required steps.

## Hosted credit card fields

Payment Services are available as a payment method when creating an order in the Admin:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, expand **Sales** and choose **Orders**.
1. Click <span class="btn">Create New Order</span>.
1. Complete sections as needed for the order (details explained in [Creating an order]({% link customers/customer-account-create-order.md %})).
1. In the _Payment Method_ section, you should be able to use your Payment Services as a payment method.
