The Payment Card Industry (PCI) established a set of requirements for businesses that accept payment by credit card over the Internet. In addition to maintaining a secure environment, merchants who handle customer credit card information are responsible for meeting some standard guidelines.

See [PCI Compliance Guidelines]({% link stores/compliance-pci.md %}) for more information.

Merchants can complete a [self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/completing_self_assessment), which is a self-validation tool to assess security for cardholder data.

## Credit Card Fields

With Credit Card Fields, no PCI-regulated data is passed across your services. You don't have to store or maintain that data, which vastly reduces PCI compliance concerns.

## PayPal Smart Buttons

With PayPal Smart Buttons, no PCI-regulated data is passed across your services. You don't have to store or maintain that data, which vastly reduces PCI compliance concerns.

For security reasons, PayPal does not pass the billing address during checkout---country, email, and name is the only billing information utilized. You can optionally enable your site's PayPal checkout to return the complete billing address by contacting PayPal and completing a vetting process.

PayPal also has integrated fraud protection that uses machine learning to help you fight fraud. See PayPal's [Seller Protection documentation](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/seller-protection) for more information.
