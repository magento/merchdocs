The Order payment status report helps you easily understand where a specific order is within the order to cash process flow. This report allows you to quickly view the payment status of your orders and identify any potential issues.

![Admin view]({% link payment-services/assets/admin-view.png %}){:height="40%" width="40%"}{: .zoom}
_Payment Services extension Admin view_

You don't have to open multiple views to manually cross-references orders and payments. Payment Services for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source enables you to get a bird's-eye-view of your orders and payments---all within the Order payment status report.

See payment statuses, invoiced and shipped statuses, refund statuses, dispute statuses, and more, all within this report in the Admin.

You can download Order payment status transactions in a .csv file format for use in existing accounting or order management software.

You cannot view financial reports if you have not [onboarded and activated Live mode]({% link payment-services/onboard-payments.md %}#activate-live-payments) for Payment Services.

## Data used in the report

We use order data, and combine it with aggregated payment data from other sources (including PayPal), to provide meaningful and highly useful reports.

Order data is exported and persisted in the payment service. When you [change or add order statuses]({% link sales/order-status-custom.md %}) or [edit a store view]({% link stores/stores-all-view-edit.md %}), [store]({% link stores/store-information.md %}), or website name, we combine that data with payment data and populate the Order payment status report with the combined info.

This happens in two steps:

1. We index changed data either `ON SAVE` (every time order info or store info is changed) or `BY SCHEDULE` (on a pre-configured cron schedule), depending on how it is configured in [Index Management]({% link system/index-management.md %}) in the Admin.

    By default, data indexation occurs `ON SAVE`. This means that whenever something changes in the order, the order status, the store view, the store, or the website, the re-indexation process will happen immediately.

1. We send the indexed data to the payment service, which then populates into the Order payment status report.

The only data that is exported and collated for reporting purposes is data used by the Order payment status report.

{:.bs-callout-info}
The data shown in this table is sorted in descending order (`DESC`) by default using the `ORDER DATE`. The `ORDER DATE` is the date timestamp when the order was created.

### Configure data export

Even though, by default, re-indexing happens in `ON SAVE` mode, we recommend you index in `BY SCHEDULE` mode. `BY SCHEDULE` runs on a cron schedule of one minute, and any changed data will appear in your Order status report within two minutes of any data change. This helps you reduce any strain on your store, especially if you have a lot of incoming orders, because re-indexing happens on a schedule (not as each order is placed).

You can change the index mode---`ON SAVE` or `BY SCHEDULE`---[in the Admin]({% link system/index-management.md %}#change-the-index-mode).

See [Configuring Payment Services]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/payment-services/configure-payments.html#configure-data-export) to see how to configure the data export.

The Filter List shows the different _FILTERING BY_ options:

## Select data source

In the Order payment status report view, you can select the data source---_Live_ or _Sandbox_---for which you want to see report results.

![Data sources selection]({% link payment-services/assets/datasource.png %}){:height="60%" width="60%"}{: .zoom}
_Data sources selection_

If _Live_ is the selected data source, you will see report information for your store(s) that utilize Payment Services in _Live_ mode. If _Sandbox_ is the selected data source, you will see report information for your Sandbox environment.

Data source selections work as follows:

* If you do not have any stores that utilize Payment Services in Live mode, the data source selection defaults to _Sandbox_.
* If you have any stores (one or multiple) that utilize Payment Services in Live mode, the data source selection defaults to _Live_.
* Report exports always honor the data source selection.

To select the data source for your Order Payment Status report:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > **Payment Services** > **Order payment status**.
1. Click the **Data source** dropdown.
1. Select _Live_ or _Sandbox_.

   The report results will regenerate based on the data source selected.
