You can customize Payment Services to your needs with helpful configuration options in the Admin.

When you configure Payment Services for {{ site.data.var.ee }} and {{ site.data.var.ce }} in the Admin, those configurations apply only to the environment that is set in the Method field of General Configuration. Any changes you make in the configuration fields are independent of switching the Method selection---if you switch the method, your selections will not reset.

See the [General Configuration section](#general-configuration) for more information.

## General configuration

You can enable Payment Services for your store, and enable either sandbox testing or live payments in the General Configuration section.
