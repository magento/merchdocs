By default, products that appear in upcoming or closed events are not available for general sale and the _Add to Cart_ button does not appear on the product list or product page.

To restore the _Add to Cart_ button for a closed event, the event must be deleted (see [Updating Events]({% link marketing/event-update.md %})). However, if a product is associated with another category that has no selling restrictions, the button is available on the product page. Similarly, the ticker block does not appear on the product page if the product is associated with another category that has no selling restrictions.
