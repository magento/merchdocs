The [sales representative]({% link customers/account-company-sales-representative.md -%}) that is assigned as the primary contact for a company is configured by default as the sender of many automated email messages sent to the company.

## Configure Company Email Options

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to  **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Customers** and choose **Company Configuration**.

1. If necessary, set **Store View** to the store view to define the [scope]({% link configuration/scope.md -%}) of the configuration.

1. Complete the fields in the following sections.

   To override the default setting of any field, clear the **Use system value** checkbox to make the field editable.

   **Company Registration**

   - Set **Company Registration Email Recipient** to the [store contact]({% link stores/store-email-addresses.md %}) who is to be notified when a new company registration request is received.

   - In the **Send Company Registration Email Copy To** field, enter the email address of each person who is to receive a copy of the registration notification. Separate multiple email addresses with a comma.

   - To determine how the copy of the notification is sent, set **Send Email Copy Method** to one of the following:

        |Bcc|Sends a _blind courtesy copy_ by including the recipient in the header of the same email that is sent to the customer. The BCC recipient is not visible to the customer.|

   - If you have prepared an email template that is to be used instead of the default, set **Default Company Registration Email** to the name of the template. By default, the `Company Registration Request` template is used.
