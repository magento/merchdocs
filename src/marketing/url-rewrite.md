title: URL Rewrites
---

The URL Rewrite tool lets you change any URL that is associated with a product, category, or CMS page. When the rewrite goes into effect, any links that point to the previous URL are redirected to the new address.

To update URL rewrites for multiple or all products simultaneously, refer to [Multiple URL Rewrites]({% link marketing/url-rewrite-update-all.md %}).

The terms _rewrite_ and _redirect_ are often used interchangeably, but refer to slightly different processes. A URL rewrite changes the way a URL appears in the browser. A URL redirect updates the URL that is stored on the server. A URL redirect can be either temporary or permanent. Your store uses URL rewrites and redirects to make it easy for you to change the URL key of a product, category, or page and preserve existing links.

By default, [automatic URL redirects]({% link marketing/url-redirect-product-automatic.md %}) are enabled for your store and the **Create Permanent Redirect for old URL** checkbox is selected under the URL key field of each product.
