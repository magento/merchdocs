The _Bought this, bought that_ recommendation type recommends products that tend to be purchased disproportionately more than others when purchasing the current item.

## How it works

The _Bought this, bought that_ recommendation type is most often on the cart or product detail page to increase exposure of related cross-sell products with the goal of increasing average order value. By aggregating what other shoppers have bought along with the current product, _Bought this, bought that_ displays highly relevant products shoppers can add to their cart.
