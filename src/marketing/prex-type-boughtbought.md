title: Bought this, bought that
---

The _Bought this, bought that_ recommendation type recommends items most often purchased by shoppers who purchased the specified item.

## How it works

You can think of the _Bought this, bought that_ recommendation type as a "Frequently bought together" recommendation. You typically see this recommendation type on the cart or product detail page to cross-sell shoppers with the goal of increasing average order value. By aggregating what other shoppers have bought along with the current product, _Bought this, bought that_ displays highly relevant products shoppers can add to their cart.
