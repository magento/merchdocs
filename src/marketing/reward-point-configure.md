## Step 1. Configure the Reward Points

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Customers** and choose **Reward Points**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Reward Points** section. Then, do the following:

    - To activate reward points, set **Enable Reward Points Functionality** to `Yes`.

    - To allow customers to earn their own reward points, set **Enable Reward Points Functionality on Storefront** to `Yes`.

    - To allow customers to see a detailed history of their rewards, set **Customers May See Reward Point History** to `Yes`.

1. In the **Reward Points Balance Redemption Threshold** field, enter the number of points that must accrue before they can be redeemed (blank for no minimum). Then, do the following:

    - Enter the maximum number of points a customer can accrue in the **Cap Reward Points Balance At** field (blank for no limit).

    - Enter the number of days before the reward points expire in the **Reward Points Expire in (days)** field (blank for no expiration).

    - Set **Reward Points Expiry Calculation** to one of the following:

        | `Static` | Determines the remaining lifetime of reward points based on the number of days set in the configuration. If the expiration limit in the configuration changes, the expiration date of existing points does not change. |
        | `Dynamic` | Calculates the number of days left whenever the reward point balance increases. If the expiration limit in the configuration changes, the expiration of all existing points update accordingly. |

    - If you want to refund available reward points automatically, set **Refund Reward Points Automatically** to `Yes`.

    - If you want to automatically deduct reward points from the amount of a refund, set **Deduct Reward Points from Refund Amount Automatically** to `Yes`.

1. Set **Landing Page** to the content page that explains your reward points program.

    Make sure to update the default Rewards Points page with your own information.

    [_Actions for Acquiring Reward Points by Customer_]({% link configuration/customers/reward-points.md -%})

    - To display a message in the shopping cart that includes the rewards points earned for the purchase and the customerâ€™s current reward point balance, set **Purchase** to `Yes`.

    - For **Registration**, enter the number of points earned for opening a customer account.

    - For **Newsletter Signup**, enter the number of points earned by registered customers who subscribe to a newsletter.

    - Set **Email Sender** to the store contact that appears as the sender of balance updates and expiration notifications.

    - If you want to subscribe customers by default to be notified of balance updates and upcoming expiration dates, set **Subscribe Customers by Default** to `Yes`.
