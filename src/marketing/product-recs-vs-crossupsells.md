When deciding to use Product Recommendations or [Product Relationships]({% link marketing/product-relationships.md %}), such as [Up-sells]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-up-sells.md %}) and [Cross-sells]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-cross-sells.md %}), you need to determine what level of control your business requires. For example, when you configure an Up-sell or Cross-sell, you specify which products and in what order those products are promoted to your shoppers. Whereas, Product Recommendations powered by Adobe Sensei uses machine-learning algorithms to recommend products to your shoppers.

## Benefits of product relationships

Product relationships allow you to:

- Promote specific products to the shopper
- Control the order the products are promoted to the shopper
- Create [rules]({% link marketing/product-related-rules.md %}) to target the selection of products that are promoted to customers as up-sells and cross-sells

## Benefits of Product Recommendations

Product Recommendations allow you to:

- Choose from nine distinct intelligent recommendation types based on the following areas: shopper-based, item-based, popularity-based, trending, and similarity-based
- Use behavioral data to personalize recommendations throughout the shopper’s storefront journey
- Measure key metrics relevant to each recommendation to help you understand the impact of your recommendations

## Best of both worlds

Given the ever-changing complexities of online shopping, what works best for your storefront is often a combination of multiple key technologies. Using both Product Recommendations and Product Relationships, gives you more flexibility when it comes to promoting products. You can leverage Product Recommendations powered by Adobe Sensei to intelligently automate your recommendations at scale. Then, you can leverage Related product rules when you need to manually intervene and ensure a very specific recommendation is being made to a specific shopper segment, or when specific business goals need to be met.
