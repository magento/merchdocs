[Yotpo](https://www.yotpo.com/) is a user-generated content marketing platform enabling merchants to gather, curate, manage, and respond to all kinds of user content from just a single platform. Yotpo integrates with Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source to help you to maximize the power of user-generated content.

Yotpo installs automatically and integrates seamlessly with your Commerce store, so you can accelerate growth by leveraging your customer feedback. With Yotpo, Commerce merchants can easily collect and intelligently display customer content such as reviews, photos, and videos at key touch points throughout the buyer journey to improve trust, social proof, and sales. Merchants can also access feedback data and insight into consumer behavior.

Available Yotpo features and customization options are dependent on the Yotpo plan you choose. Commerce supports the Free, Growth, and Premium plans. See Yotpo [Plan Information](https://www.yotpo.com/pricing/) for plans and features.
