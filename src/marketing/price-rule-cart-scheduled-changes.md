Cart price rules can be applied on schedule as part of a campaign, and grouped with other content changes. You can create a new campaign based on scheduled changes to a price rule, or apply the changes to an existing campaign.

{:.bs-callout-info}
All scheduled updates are applied consecutively. This means that any entity can have only one scheduled update at one point of time. Any scheduled update is applied to all store views within its time frame. As a result, an entity cannot have different scheduled updates for different store views at the same time. All entity attribute values within all store views, which are not affected by the current scheduled update, are taken from the default values, and not from the previous scheduled update.

Keep in mind the following caveats:

- If a campaign that includes a price rule is initially created without an end date, the campaign cannot later be edited to include an end date. It is recommended that you either add an end date when you create the campaign or create a duplicate version of the existing campaign and add the end date to the duplicate as needed.
- When using a scheduled update to enable a cart price rule with an end date, be sure to set the rule as initially disabled. Rules that are already active will not respect the end date.
- Coupons are not specifically connected to cart price rules. A Scheduled Update does not provide access to the _Coupon_, _Coupon Code_, _Uses per Coupon_, and _Uses per Customer_ fields on the _Rule Information_ tab.  Additionally, all settings from the _Manage Coupon Codes_ tab are not available.

Campaign **Start Date** and **End Date** must be defined by using the **_default_** Admin time zone, which is converted from each website local time zone. For example, if you have multiple websites in different time zones, but you want to start campaign based on a US time zone, you need to schedule separate update for each local time zone, and set **Start Date** and **End Date** in converted from each local website time zone to default Admin time zone.

If there are multiple price rules running in the same campaign, the Priority setting of the price rule determines which rule takes precedence. To learn more, see [Content Staging]({% link cms/content-staging.md -%}).
