title: Google AdWords
---

[Google AdWords][1] is a service that you can use to place ads in Google Search results and on the pages of companies in the Google Display Network. The AdWords dashboard includes tools to manage your campaigns, track response, and measure results.

Conversion tracking shows how many ad clicks lead to a sale or other valuable action. The _Success_ page that appears to your customer after an order has been submitted is used to track conversions because it appears only after a sale. After completing the Google AdWords configuration for your store, there is no need to copy the conversion tracking script to the Success page, because Magento already has the necessary information. To learn more, see [Google AdWorlds Help][2].

## Step 1. Create a Google AdWords Campaign

1. Visit [Google AdWords][3], and sign up for an account.

1. Follow the instructions to create a campaign.

1. To set up conversion tracking for your campaign, do the following:

    - When prompted for the conversion source, choose **Website**

    - Enter a name for the conversion action that you want to track. Then, click <span class="btn">Done</span>.

    - Click **Value** and, if applicable, assign a value to the conversion. For example:

        - If you make $5 on each sale, choose `Each time it happens` and assign a value of `$5`.
        - If the value of each sale varies, leave the value blank.

        Then, click <span class="btn">Done</span>.

    - Click <span class="btn">Conversion windows</span> and complete the settings to determine how long the conversions are to be tracked, the reporting category, and the attribution model.

## Step 2. Get Your Conversion Tag

1. Under **Install your tag**, choose to count conversions on **Page load**.

    The notification appears in the lower corner with a link to Google's security standards and cookie usage.

1. To choose how you want to manage the your AdWords tag, do one of the following:

    - If you plan to add the script to your store yourself, choose **Save instructions and tag**.
    - If you plan to have someone else add the script to your store, choose **Email instructions and tag**.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Done</span>.

## Step 3. Configure Your Store

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. If configuring Google AdWords tor a specific store view, do the following:

    - In the upper-left corner, choose the **Store View** that is to be configured.

    - When prompted to confirm scope switching, click <span class="btn">OK</span>.

1. In the left panel, expand **Sales** and choose **Google API**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Google AdWords** section and do the following:

    If necessary, clear the **Use Website** checkbox for each setting to be changed.

    - Set **Enable** to `Yes`.

    - Enter the **Conversion ID** from your Google AdWords script.

1. To format the Google Sites Stat notification, do the following:

    - Set **Conversion Language** to the language that is identified in your Google AdWords script.

    - Enter the **Conversion Format** to be used for the Google Sites Stat notification on the conversion page.

        |1 |Displays a one-line notification with a link to more information about Google tracking.|
        |2 |Displays a two-line notification with a link to more information about Google tracking.|
        |3 |Displays no customer notification.|

    - Enter the [hexadecimal code][4]{:target="_blank"} for the **Conversion Color** that you want to use for the Google Site Stats notification label.

    - Enter the encrypted text for the **Conversion Label** that appears on the Google Sites Stat notification.

        For example: `MlEYCOKBnGoQz6CZoAM`

        **Sample Google AdWords Tag Code**

        ```html
        <!-- Google Code for Back to School Sale Conversion Page -->
        <script type="text/javascript">
        /* <![CDATA[ */
        var google_conversion_id = 999999999;
        var google_conversion_language = "en";
        var google_conversion_format = "3";
        var google_conversion_color = "ffffff";
        var google_conversion_label = "MlEYCOKBnGoQz6CZoAM";
        var google_remarketing_only = false;
        /* ]]> */
        </script>

        <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion.js">
        </script>
        <noscript>
        <div style="display:inline;">
        <img height="1" width="1" style="border-style:none;" alt="" src="//www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/872829007/?label=MlEYCOKBnGoQz6CZoAM&amp;guid=ON&amp;script=0"/>

        </noscript>
        ```

1. Set **Conversion Value Type** to one of the following:

   |Dynamic|Determines that a conversion has occurred based on the dynamic Order Amount value.|
   |Constant|Determines that a conversion has occurred based on a specific value entered.|

    For a Constant conversion value type, enter a specific **Value** for the Order Amount to qualify as a conversion.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.

## Step 4. Verify the Configuration

Within a few hours, the tracking status in your Google AdWords dashboard changes from `Unverified` to `No recent conversions` or `Recording conversions`. When someone clicks your ad and makes a purchase, the conversion appears on the Conversion Actions page of your dashboard and campaign report.
