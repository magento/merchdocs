    - Enter a descriptive **Block Title** for internal reference. For example: `Facebook Like Button`.

    - Assign a unique **Identifier** to the block, using all lowercase characters, and underscores instead of spaces. For example: `facebook_like_button`.

    - If your Magento installation has multiple store views, choose each **Store View** where the block is to be available.

    <!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
    - If using Page Builder, add an [HTML Code]({% link cms/page-builder-elements-html-code.md %}) block to the stage, and paste the snippet of code that you copied from the Facebook site. Otherwise, paste the snippet of code into the **Content** box.
    <!--{% endif %}-->
    <!--{% if "Default.CE Only" contains site.edition %}-->
    - Paste the snippet of code that you copied from the Facebook site into the **Content** box.
    <!--{% endif %}-->

    - If the block is not ready to go live, set **Enable Block** to `No`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Block</span>.

## Step 3. Place the Block

<!--{% if "Default.EE-B2B" contains site.edition %}-->
1. If using Page Builder, follow the instructions to [add the block]({% link cms/page-builder-add-content-block.md %}) to the stage.

   Otherwise, on the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Content** > _Elements_ > **Widgets**.
<!--{% endif %}-->
<!--{% if "Default.CE Only" contains site.edition %}-->

<!--{% endif %}-->

1. In the upper-right corner, click **Add Widget** and do the following:

    - In the Settings section, set **Type** to `CMS Static Block` and click <span class="btn">Continue</span>.

    - Verify that **Design Theme** is set to the current theme.

    - Enter a number in the **Sort Order** field to determine the order of the block if it assigned to appear in the same location on the page as other content elements. The top position is zero.

1. In the Layout Updates section, click <span class="btn">Add Layout Update</span>. Then, set **Display On** to the category, product, or page where you want the block to appear.

    For example, if you choose `All Pages` and position the block in either the header or footer, the block will appear in the same place on every page of the store.

    To place the block on a specific page, do the following:

    - Set **Display On** to `Specified Page`. Then, select the **Page** where you want the block to appear.

    The widget now appears in the Widgets grid.

## Step 4. Verify the Location in Your Store
