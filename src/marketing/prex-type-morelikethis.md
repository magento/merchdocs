title: More like this
---

The _More like this_ recommendation type recommends items based on similar content and attributes to the product being viewed.

## How it works

By comparing products in your catalog to the product being viewed, products in a cart, or products on the confirmation page, Magento can recommend other similar products within that category. For example, if a shopper is browsing yoga mats, the _More like this_ recommendation type recommends other products within the equipment category. Because _More like this_ does not distinguish between genders, this recommendation type is not recommended for clothing stores.

### Where used
