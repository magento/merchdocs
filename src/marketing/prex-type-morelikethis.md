title: More like this

The _More like this_ recommendation type recommends items based on similar content and attributes to the product being viewed.

## How it works

By evaluating the attributes for the products being viewed, _More like this_ recommends other similar products within the same category. For example, if a shopper is browsing yoga mats, the _More like this_ recommendation type recommends other products within the equipment category. Because _More like this_ does not currently distinguish between genders, this recommendation type is not recommended for apparel, fashion, or other gender-specific verticals.
