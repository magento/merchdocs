Reward points can be awarded to customers on the basis of a [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md -%}). The award of points can be the only action of the price rule, or can be used in combination with a discount.

## Add Reward Points to a Price Rule

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Promotions_ > **Cart Price Rules**.

1. Do one of the following:

    - Click an existing cart price rule to open it.
    - Click <span class="btn">Add New Rule</span> to create a new cart price rule.

1. Scroll down, expand ![Expansion selector]({% link assets/icon-display-expand.png %}) the **Actions** section, set the conditions, and enter the amount of points in the **Add Reward Points** field.

    _Adding Reward Points to Price Rule_

1. Follow the standard instructions to complete the [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart-create.md %}).

   When the price rule is activated, a message appears in the cart to let customers know how many points they can earn by placing the order. This applies only to registered users and may vary when a user is logged in.
