## Rotation Modes Description

{: .rotation-modes-table }
| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| By Priority, Then by ID | Products are sorted by priority and then reordered by ID inside each priority. Products from lower priority rule will show up only when they are no products left from higher priority rule to fill the available slots. |
| By Priority, Then Random | Products are sorted by priority and then randomized inside each priority. Products from lower priority rule will show up only when they are no products left from higher priority rule to fill the available slots. |
| Weighted Random | Products are randomized such that products belonging to rule with higher priority will have higher probability to appear than those belonging to rule with lower priority. Products are then reduced to the configurable maximum limit and regrouped back by priority. This mode gives a chance to products from lower priority to appear sometimes even if the remaining slots could be filled up with products from rule with higher priority|
