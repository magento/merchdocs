title: Viewed this, bought that

The _Viewed this, bought that_ recommendation type recommends products other shoppers purchased disproportionally more after viewing the current product.

## How it works

Similar to _Bought this, bought that_, the _Viewed this, bought that_ recommendation type recommends products other shoppers purchased disproportionally more after viewing the current product. _Viewed this, bought that_ does not recommend products that are popular across the board. This is an effective recommendation type because it serves to help guide a shopper, who might be in their research phase, to expand their view and discover products that they might not have otherwise noticed.
