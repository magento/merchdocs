Compare Products generates a detailed, side-by-side comparison of two or more products. Depending on the theme, the Add to Compare link might be represented by an icon or text. The Compare Products block usually appears in either the left or right sidebar of a catalog page.

Unlike the [Recently Viewed / Compared Products ]({% link marketing/products-viewed-compared.md %}) block, the Admin does not include additional configuration settings for Compare Products.

## Compare products on the storefront

There are a few ways to use comparison list on the storefront.

### From catalog pages

1. The customer finds the products that they want to compare and clicks the **Add to Compare** link for each.

1. Navigates to an associated category page.

    Depending on the theme and page layout, there might be a _Compare Products_ block in the sidebar. If so, the items in the category that are marked for comparison are listed.

    The customer can click **Delete** (![Delete icon]({% link assets/icon-delete-x.png %})) for any product to remove it from the comparison report, or click **Clear All** to remove all items and start over with your compare selections.

1. Clicks <span class="btn">Compare</span>.

1. To print the comparison information, clicks **Print This Page**.

1. To remove a single product from the comparison page, clicks **Delete** (![Delete icon]({% link assets/icon-delete-x.png %})).
