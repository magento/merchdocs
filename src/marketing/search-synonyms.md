The standard search functionality described in this topic differs from [Live Search]({% link live-search/overview.md %}). To learn more, see [Synonyms]({% link live-search/synonyms.md %}) in the Live Search section of the user guide.

One way to improve the effectiveness of catalog search is to include different terms that people may use to describe the same item. You do not want to lose a sale just because someone is looking for a _sofa_, while your product is listed as a _couch_. Or perhaps they spelled it wrong, or just differently. Is it a _sweatshirt_, or a _sweat shirt_? Maybe it is a _fleece_ or a _hoodie_. You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words a customer might use to find your products.

   - Set **Scope** to the store views where the synonyms apply.

   - Enter each synonym in the group, separated by comma. Choose words that people might use as search criteria. For example:

      - `sweatshirt, sweat shirt, hoodie, fleece`
      - `cell phone, mobile phone, smart phone`
      - `couch, sofa, davenport`
      - `wrought iron, rot iron, rod iron`

   - To merge these synonyms into a group with others that have the same scope, select the **Merge existing synonyms** checkbox.
