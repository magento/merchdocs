title: Search Synonyms
---

One way to improve the effectiveness of catalog search is to include different terms that people may use to describe the same item. You do not want to lose a sale just because someone is looking for a _sofa_, while your product is listed as a _couch_. Or perhaps they spelled it wrong, or just differently. Is it a _sweatshirt_, or a _sweat shirt_? Maybe it is a _fleece_ or a _hoodie_. You can capture a broad range of search terms by entering all the possible words a customer might use to find your products.

   - Set **Scope** to the store views where the synonyms apply.

   - Enter each synonym in the group, separated by comma. Choose words that people might use as search criteria. For example:

      - `sweatshirt, sweat shirt, hoodie, fleece`
      - `cell phone, mobile phone, smart phone`
      - `couch, sofa, davenport`
      - `wrought iron, rot iron, rod iron`

   - To merge these synonyms into a group with others that have the same scope, select the **Merge existing synonyms** checkbox.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Synonym Group</span>.
