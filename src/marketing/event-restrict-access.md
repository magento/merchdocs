   - Set **Access Restriction** to `Yes`.

   - Set **Restriction Mode** to one of the following:

      - `Website Closed`

      - `Private Sales: Login and Register`

   - Set **Startup Page** to one of the following:

        |To login form (302 Found)|Users are redirected to the login form before gaining access to the site.|
        |To landing page (302 Found)|Users are redirected to the specified landing page until they log in. <br/>**Important!** Be sure to include a link to the login page from the landing page so customers can log in to access the site.|

   - Choose the **Landing Page** that appears before customers log in to the private sale site.

   - To let search engine bots and spiders know that the landing page is correct and there are no other pages on the site to index, set **HTTP Response** to `200 OK`. In all other cases set to `503 Service Unavailable`.
