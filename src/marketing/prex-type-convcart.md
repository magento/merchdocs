The _Conversion (view to cart)_ recommendation type recommends products with the highest view to cart conversion rate.

## How it works

The _Conversion (view to cart)_ recommendation type calculates the proportion of sessions with a product view that register a subsequent view to cart event for the same SKU in the last seven days. Simply put, out of all the shopper sessions that viewed the product, what percentage added that product to their cart?
