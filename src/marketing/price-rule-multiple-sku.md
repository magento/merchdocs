title: Price Rule with Multiple SKUs
---

A single price rule can be applied to multiple SKUs, which makes it possible to create a variety of promotions based on a product, brand, or category. When creating this rule, you want to set conditions to match any products of selected SKUs. When building the rule, you can easily browse and select SKUs without needing to know all of your product SKUs from memory.

## Step 1. Verify Storefront Properties of Attribute

Before you begin, make sure that the Storefront Properties of the SKU attribute are set to `Use in Promo Rules`.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Attributes_ > **Product**.

1. In the search filter at the top of the **Attribute** Column, enter `sku` and click <span class="btn">Search</span>.

1. Click to open the attribute in edit mode.

1. In the left panel, choose **Storefront Properties**. Then, make sure that **Use for Promo Rule Conditions** is set to `Yes`.

1. If you changed the value of the property, click <span class="btn">Save Attribute</span>.

## Step 2. Apply a Price Rule to Multiple SKUs

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, click **Marketing**. > _Promotions_ > **Cart Price Rules**.

1. Do one of the following:

   - Follow the instructions to create a new [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}).
   - Open an existing cart price rule.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Conditions** section, and do the following:

    - In the first line, set the first parameter to `ANY`.

        ![Cart price rule condition - ANY]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-multiple-skus-condition1.png %}){: .zoom}
        _If ANY of these conditions are TRUE_

    - Click **Add** (![Add icon]({% link images/images/btn-add-grn.png %})) at the beginning of the next line. Then, in the list under **Product Attribute**, choose `SKU`.

        ![Cart price rule condition - SKU is one of]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-multiple-skus-condition1b.png %}){: .zoom}
        _SKU is one of …_

    - For the comparison, you have options. If you want to locate at least one from a list of SKUs, `select is one of`. If you want to locate a group of SKUs that all must be found to apply, select `is`. We recommend selecting `is one of`.

    - To complete the condition, click the (**…**) more link. Then, click the **Chooser** (![List icon]({% link images/images/btn-chooser.png %})) icon for the list of available products.

        ![Cart price rule condition - multiple SKUs]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-multiple-skus-condition2.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Choose Each SKU_

    - Browse, filter, or search to find the SKUs you want to add. In the list, select the checkbox of each product that is to be included. Then, click <span class="btn">Save and Apply</span> to add the SKUs to the condition.

        ![Cart price rule condition - multiple SKUs]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-multiple-skus-condition2b.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Multiple SKUs Added to Condition_

1. Complete the rule, including any [Actions]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %}) to be taken when the conditions are met.

1. When your rule is complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
