RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based data format that is used to distribute information online. Your customers can subscribe to your RSS feeds to learn of new products and promotions. RSS Feeds can also be used to publish your product information to shopping aggregation sites, and can be included in newsletters.

When RSS feeds are enabled, any additions to products, specials, categories, and coupons are automatically sent to the subscribers of each feed. A link to all RSS feeds that you publish is in the footer of your store.

*The orange RSS symbol is typically used to identify an RSS feed.*

The software that is required to read an RSS feed is called a feed reader, and allows people to subscribe to headlines, blogs, podcasts, and much more. Google Reader is one of the many feed readers that are available online for free.
