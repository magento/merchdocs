The _Recommended for you_ recommendation type recommends items based on each shopper’s current and previous on site behavior.

## How it works

By analyzing a shopper's browsing and purchase history, _Recommended for you_ displays recommendations that are highly relevant to the current shopper. This recommendation type is very effective on the home page where the majority of shoppers begin their journey on a site. For first-time shoppers on your site who have not have generated any signal to personalize their experience, Magento will show items based on the _Most viewed_ recommendation type. As soon as this shopper starts to interact with the products on the site, however, recommended products will adjust to their behavior in real-time.
