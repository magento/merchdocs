title: Recommended for you
---

The _Recommended for you_ recommendation type recommends items based on each shopper’s current and previous on site behavior.

## How it works

By analyzing a shopper's browsing and purchase history, _Recommended for you_ displays recommendations that are highly relevant to the current shopper. This recommendation type is very effective on the home page where the majority of shoppers begin their journey on a site. Because _Recommended for you_ uses behavioral data, a first time shopper on your site will not have generated enough data to accurately recommended personalized products. You should allow the system to run for 24 hours so it can start collecting data. Until enough data is collected, however, Magento will surface items based on the _Most viewed_ recommendation type to this shopper.
