title: Magento Product Reviews
---

Customers can write reviews for any product in your catalog. Reviews can be written from the product page by clicking:

- **Add Your Review** for products with existing reviews.

- **Be the first to review this product** for products with no existing reviews.

The Reviews tab lists all current reviews and the form that was used to submit a review.

Your configuration determines whether customers must open an account with your store before writing product reviews or if they can submit reviews as guests. Requiring reviewers to open an account prevents anonymous submissions and improves the quality of reviews.

_Add Your Review_

The number of stars indicates the product's satisfaction rating. Visitors can click the link to read the reviews and write their own. As an incentive, customers can receive reward points for submitting a review. When a review is submitted, it is sent to the Admin for moderation. When approved, the review is published in your store.
