title: Using a Site Map

A site map improves the way your store is indexed by search engines, and is specifically designed to find pages that might be overlooked by web crawlers. A site map can be configured to index all pages and images.

When enabled, Commerce creates a file called `sitemap.xml` that is saved to your installation in the location that you specify. The configuration gives you the ability to set the frequency of the updates, and the priority for each type of content. Your site map should be updated as frequently as the content on your site changes, which might be daily, weekly, or monthly.

While your site is in development, you might include instructions in the `robots.txt` file for web crawlers to avoid indexing the site. Then before the launch, you can change the instructions to allow the site to be indexed.

For technical information, see [Add sitemap and robots.txt][1]{:target="_blank"} in the developer documentation.

_Site Map in Grid_

## Step 1. Configure the site map

Complete the [XML Sitemap configuration]({% link marketing/sitemap-xml-configure.md %}) to determine what is included, and how frequently the site map is updated.

## Step 2. Generate the site map

1. On the _Admin_ menu, go to **Marketing** > _SEO & Search_ > **Site Map**.

1. Click <span class="btn">Add Site Map</span> and do the following:

    ![Site map grid]({% link marketing/assets/marketing-sitemap.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Site Map_

    - Enter the site map **Filename**. For example: `sitemap.xml`

    - Enter the **Path** to determine where the site map file is to reside on the server. Make sure that the path is writeable.

        | /sitemap/ | Places the site map file in a directory called _sitemap_. |
        | / | Places the site map file at the base path, or root of your Commerce installation. |

    ![New site map]({% link marketing/assets/marketing-sitemap-new.png %}){: .zoom}
    _New Site Map_

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save & Generate</span>.

    It might take a few minutes for the site map to appear in the grid.

## Step 3. Configure and enable robots.txt (Optional)

Complete the [Search Engine Robots]({% link marketing/search-engine-robots.md -%}) configuration with instructions that direct search engines to crawl the parts of your site that you want to be indexed.

## Step 4. Submit your site map to search engines

You can submit your site map to different search engines by providing them the link to the `sitemap.xml` file in your Commerce installation. To copy the link, do the following:

1. In the Site Map grid, right-click the URL in the **Link for Google** column.

1. On the menu, choose **Copy Link Address**.

For more information, see the instructions for the specific search engine. Here are links to instructions for two top search engines:

- [Google][2]
- [Microsoft Bing][3]

## Step 5: Restore previous robot instructions **(Optional)**

You can now restore either the original (default) restrictions.

## Manage sitemaps and robots.txt for multiple websites

If you have multiple websites, you can simplify the process of creating and submitting sitemaps by [creating]({% link marketing/sitemap-xml-configure.md %}) one or more sitemaps that include URLs for all your verified stores, and saving the sitemap(s) to a single location. All sites must be verified in [Google Search Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001).

To create sitemaps for a multistore instance, do the following:

1. Create a new folder called `sitemaps` at the root of your website, then create subfolders for each domain:

    /sitemaps/domain_1/
    /sitemaps/domain_2/

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _SEO & Search_ > **Site Map**.

1. Create or edit the sitemap listings for each store and set the **Path** to the one you created for the store:

    /sitemaps/domain_1/
    /sitemaps/domain_2/

1. If needed, update your robots.txt file.

   To make sure that the search engine spiders are properly directed to the new sitemaps, you might need to update or create the robots.txt file and add the following lines at the top.

Website Sitemap

    Sitemap: http://www.domain_1.com/sitemaps/domain_1/sitemap.xml
    Sitemap: http://www.domain_2.com/sitemaps/domain_2/sitemap.xml

{:.bs-callout-info}
If your site uses the [Apache]({{ site.devdocs_url }}/guides/v{{ site.version }}/install-gde/prereq/apache.html) web server engine, you should update the [.htaccess](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html) file in the root of your website to direct any other sitemap requests to the proper place.
