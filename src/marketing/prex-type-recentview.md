The _Recently viewed_ recommendation type displays products most recently viewed by the shopper.

## How it works

Not technically a recommendation type, _Recently viewed_ displays products based on the user's browser history. Products are displayed from most recently viewed to least recently viewed. Before being displayed, the recommendation unit removes any deleted products. If the user does not have any browser history or there is not enough history when [filter rules]({% link marketing/recommendation-incl-excl.md %}) are applied, the recommendation unit is not displayed. If the results contain fewer products than [configured]({% link marketing/create-new-rec.md %}), the recommendation unit displays only the products returned.

You cannot [preview]({% link marketing/create-new-rec.md %}#preview) the _Recently viewed_ recommendation type because the data used is not available for display in the Admin.
