## Categories

Each event is associated with a [category]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link catalog/category-create.md -%}) from your catalog.

## Events

[Event]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/event-ticker.md -%}) sales are based on a starting and ending date. You can use a countdown ticker to show the time remaining.

## Catalog Event Carousel

When the [Catalog Event widget]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link cms/widget-event-carousel.md -%}) is enabled in the configuration, it can be placed on store pages as a listing of open and upcoming events, sorted by end date. If two or more events share the same end date, the events are sorted based on the order specified in the configuration.

## Customer Groups

Category permissions are based primarily on [customer groups]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link customers/customer-groups.md -%}).

## Category Permissions

[Category permissions]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link catalog/category-permissions.md -%}) gives you full control over the specific activities that can take place in a given category.

## Website Restrictions

Prevents public [access]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/event-restrict-access.md -%}) to the site by redirecting to a landing page, login page, or registration page.

## Invitations

Email messages are sent with a link to create an account in the store. You can restrict the ability to create an account to only those who receive an [invitation]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/invitations.md -%}).

## Private Sales Reports

The [Private Sales Reports]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link reports/private-sales-reports.md -%}) provide information about invitations sent, customers invited, and conversions.
