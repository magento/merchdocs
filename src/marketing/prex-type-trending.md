The _Trending_ recommendation type recommends items based on recent momentum of a productâ€™s popularity across your site. Trending products are those often referred to as "Trending now", "Hot items", and so on.

## How it works

Adobe Sensei aggregates browsing and purchase data across your site to determine and rank which products are the most popular with your shoppers. The _Trending_ recommendation type can be used on all page types. For example, if a shopper is browsing a pair of black pants on a product detail page, _Trending_ displays products within the same category of the current product. When used on the home page, _Trending_ recommends items that are recently popular across the entire site. _Trending_ does not display products that are consistently popular, but rather those that have recently become popular. For example, if you have an email marketing campaign promoting certain products, the click-through rate generated by the email will increase the likelihood that those promoted products are classified as trending.
