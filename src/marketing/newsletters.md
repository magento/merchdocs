Publishing a regular newsletter is considered to be one of the most powerful and affordable marketing tools available. Commerce gives you the ability to publish and distribute newsletters to customers who have subscribed, plus tools to produce your newsletter, build and manage your list of subscribers, develop content, and drive traffic to your store. You can also use [Page Hierarchy]({% link cms/editor.md %}) to create an archive of past issues.

You can add capabilities by integrating your Commerce instance with a third-party newsletter service provider and by adding extensions. To learn more, see [Commerce Marketplace]({% link magento/magento-marketplace.md %}).
