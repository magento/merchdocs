When invitations are enabled, customers can send and view invitations from the dashboard of their customer accounts. The invitation email includes a link to your store’s [Customer Login]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link customers/customer-account.md -%}) page.

### Invitation Workflow

1. **Customer prepares invitations**: From the account dashboard, the customer prepares the list of recipients, and completes the invitation. A custom message can be included, depending on the configuration.
1. **Customer sends invitations**: When ready, the customer taps the Send Invitations button.
1. **System manages transmission**: The system sends invitations in batches, according to the number set in the configuration.
1. **Customer monitors response**: The customer monitors the status of each invitation from the account dashboard, as having been Sent, Accepted, or Canceled.
