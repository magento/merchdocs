Your dotdigital account is [synced]({% link configuration/dotdigital/sync-settings.md %}) with your store, and maintains up-to-date address books of your customers, guests, and subscribers.

## View Your Contacts

1. On the dotdigital menu, go to **Campaigns** > **My campaigns**.

    The contact list in the main menu at the top of the page includes customer, guest, and subscription data that is automatically imported from your store.
