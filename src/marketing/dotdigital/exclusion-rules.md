Create an exclusion rule in Magento to prevent abandoned cart and review emails from being sent from dotdigital [campaigns]({% link marketing/dotdigital/campaign-create.md %}) under certain conditions. A rule describes the conditions that must be met to trigger the action. For example, a rule might exclude all abandoned carts with a subtotal that is equal to, or less than ten.
