_Chat Widget on Home Page_

The Chat widget is available on all pages of your store, although there is a delay of a few seconds before it appears on each page to give the customer the opportunity to view the entire page. The Chat widget can be hidden from view as needed, and restored by clicking the button in the lower-right corner.

_Live Chat During Checkout_

When Chat is enabled in the Magento configuration, the Chat option appears in the left navigation of your dotdigital account. From the Chats page of your account, you can access your personal chats, all chats related to your account, or those of a specific team. You can also manage your chats in real time from the [Chat Settings]({% link configuration/dotdigital/chat-settings.md %}) configuration in the Magento Admin.
