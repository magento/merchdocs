The _Chat_ widget is available on all pages of your store, although there is a delay of a few seconds before it appears to give the customer the opportunity to view the entire page. The _Chat_ widget can be hidden as needed, and restored by clicking the button in the lower-right corner.

When _Chat_ is enabled in your Commerce configuration, the _Chat_ option appears in the left navigation of your dotdigital account. From the _Chats_ page of your account, you can access your personal chats, all chats related to your account, or those of a specific team. You can also manage your chats in real time from the [Chat Settings]({% link configuration/dotdigital/chat-settings.md %}) configuration in the Commerce _Admin_.
