Transactional email messages are automatically generated by the dotdigital system in response to an event such as an order confirmation, shipping notification, or password change. Transactional email messages are a legally distinct category and must not contain any content that is related to marketing or sales.

To send transactional email through the API you can use either the REST operation `Send transactional email` or the SOAP method `SendTransactionalEmail`. Transactional email is sent by SMTP, and requires a dedicated user email address. To learn more, see [Transactional email - an overview][1].

## Add a Transactional Email User

1. Click the **Settings** (![]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-btn-settings.png %}){: .Inline}) icon at the bottom of the sidebar and choose **Access**.

1. On the _Access_ page, choose the **Transactional email users** tab.

1. Click <span class="btn">New user</span>. Then under _User Details_, do the following:

    - Accept the randomly-generated **Email address**. Each transactional email user is assigned a unique email address.

    - In the **Description** field, describe how the account is to be used.

      Because this field appears in the list after the randomly-generated email address, it should make the user easy to identify.
