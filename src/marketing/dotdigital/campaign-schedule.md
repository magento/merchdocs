You now have a campaign and a list of customers. The next step is to schedule the campaign and send it on its way.

## Schedule a Campaign

1. On the main menu under _Campaigns_, choose **My Campaigns**.

    ![dotdigital - send your campaign]({% link marketing/assets/engagement-cloud-campaigns-send.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Send your campaign_

1. Find your test campaign in the list and click **Send** ( ![Send icon]({% link marketing/assets/engagement-cloud-btn-send.png %})) in the last column. Then, do the following:

    - Under _Step 1_, select the checkbox of each address book that contains contacts to be targeted by the campaign.

        ![dotdigital - program end node]({% link marketing/assets/engagement-cloud-campaign-schedule.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Choose the address book_

    - Under _Step 2_, choose the **Scheduled** option. Then, click the **Calendar** (![Calendar icon]({% link marketing/assets/engagement-cloud-btn-calendar.png %})) to choose the **Date** and enter **Time** that the campaign will be sent.

    - Under _Step 3_, select `Yes` if you want to automatically resend the campaign to anyone who has not opened it after a specific number of days.

      You can also change the subject line of the message. By default, campaigns are not sent a second time.
