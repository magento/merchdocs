You now have a campaign and a list of customers. The next step is to schedule the campaign and send it on its way.

## Schedule a Campaign

1. On the main menu under **Campaigns**, choose **My Campaigns**.

    ![dotdigital - send your campaign]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaigns-send.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Send Your Campaign_

1. Find your test campaign in the list and click **Send** ( ![Send icon]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-btn-send.png %})) in the last column. Then, do the following:

    - Under Step 1, select the checkbox of each address book that contains contacts to be targeted by the campaign.

        ![dotdigital - program end node]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-schedule.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Choose the Address Book_

    - Under Step 2, choose the **Scheduled** option. Then, click the **Calendar** ( ![Calendar icon]({% link images/images/icon-calendar-engagement-cloud.png %})) to choose the **Date** and enter **Time** that the campaign will be sent.

        ![dotdigital - campaign schedule]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-schedule-when.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Schedule the Campaign_

    - Under Step 3, select `Yes` if you want to automatically resend the campaign to anyone who has not opened it after a specific number of days.

      You can also change the subject line of the message. By default, campaigns are not sent a second time.

        ![dotdigital - remail options]({% link images/images/engagement-cloud-campaign-remail.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Remail Options_

1. Click <span class="btn">Save & continue</span>.

1. Take one last look at the report before you send the campaign. Then, scroll down to the bottom and click **Send campaign immediately**. When prompted to confirm, click <span class="btn">Send</span>.

   Your campaign is now on its way.
