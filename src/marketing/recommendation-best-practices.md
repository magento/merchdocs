This section includes best practices using recommendations on your storefront.

## General

Magento recommends the following guidelines when using recommendations:

- Diversify your recommendation types. Customers start ignoring recommendations if they suggest the same products over and over again.

- Do not deploy the same recommendations to your cart page and order confirmation page. Consider using `Most Added to Cart` for the cart page and `Bought This, Bought That` for the order confirmation page.

- Keep your site tidy. Do not deploy more than three recommendation units on same page.

- If your store sells clothing, the `More like this` recommendation can suggest gender-specific items that do not match the gender of the product being viewed. Consider only using this recommendation type for non-clothing categories.

## Usage

Magento provides a large set of recommendations you can deploy to various pages on your site. But which recommendations should you use on those pages? The following table provides some suggestions:

|Page|Recommendation Type|
|---|---|
|Home page|Recommended for you|
|Product page|Viewed this, viewed that|
|Cart|Bought this, bought that|

Remember that experimentation is key. Try the above, track metrics, then adjust if needed.

## Metrics

Metrics are a powerful tool to help you track the success of a recommendation. The following best practices illustrate how you can use metrics to create actionable insights:

- **Viewability %** - This metric measures how frequently a rendered recommendation unit is viewed. If viewability is low but click through rate is high, consider moving the recommendation higher up on the page to make it more viewable.

- **Click-through-rate (CTR) %** - This metric measures how frequently items within the recommendation unit are clicked. If a recommendation unit has a low click-through rate compared to other recommendation units, consider deploying different recommendations or moving the recommendation higher up on the page.

## Labels {#bplabels}

The label you give a recommendation affects how a shopper interprets the contents as being relevant to them. The following table gives guidance on label names.
