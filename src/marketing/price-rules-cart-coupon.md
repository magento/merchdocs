title: Coupon Codes
---

Coupons codes are used with [cart price rules]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}) to apply a discount when a set of conditions is met. For example, a coupon code can be created for a specific customer group, or for anyone who makes a purchase over a certain amount. To apply the coupon to a purchase, the customer can enter the coupon code in the cart, or possibly at the cash register of your _brick and mortar_ store. Here are a few ways that you can use coupons in your store:

- Email coupons to customers
- Produce printed coupons
- Create in-store coupons for mobile users

Coupon codes can be sent by email, or included in newsletters, catalogs, and advertisements. The list of coupon codes can be exported and sent to a commercial printer. You can also create in-store coupons with a quick response code that shoppers can scan with their smart phones. The QR code can link to a page on your site with more information about the promotion.
