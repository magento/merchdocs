title: Configuring Coupon Codes
---

The length and format of automatically generated coupon codes is controlled by the configuration. The characters can be set to all numbers, all letters, or a combination. You can insert a dash at set intervals to make it easy to read, and add a .prefix and suffix to associate the code with a specific campaign or initiative.
