title: Creating a Catalog Price Rule
---

Follow these instructions to apply a discount to specific products whenever a set of conditions is met. Catalog price rule discounts go into effect before the product is placed into the shopping cart.

## Step 1: Add a New Rule

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Promotions_ > **Catalog Price Rule**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add New Rule</span>.

   The Rule Information section includes expandable sections for Conditions and Actions.

   ![Catalog price rule - information]({% link images/images-ee/price-rule-catalog-new-ee.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Rule Information_{:.ee-only}

1. In the **Rule Information** section, do the following:

   - Complete the **Rule Name** and **Description** fields. These fields are for your internal reference only.

   - {:.ce-only}Set the **Status** of the price rule as needed. By default, the status is `Active`.

      {:.bs-callout-info}
      After the rule is created, its status can be updated by changing the status to `Active` or `Inactive` as needed.

   - Select the **Websites** where the rule is to be available.

   - Select the **Customer Groups** to which this rule applies.

        To choose multiple groups, hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) and click each option.

        {:.bs-callout-info}
        The options in this list is dependent on the customer groups created and managed in _Customers_ > _Customer Groups_.

   - {:.ce-only}Enter the **From** and **To** dates to determine when the price rule is in effect.

        You can enter the dates or use the **Calendar** (![Calendar icon]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %})) to choose the dates. If you leave the dates blank, the rule is enabled as soon as the price rule is saved.

   - Enter a number to establish the **Priority** of this rule in relation to other rules.

        {:.bs-callout-info}
        The Priority setting is important when the same catalog product meet the conditions set for more than one price rule. The rule with the highest Priority setting (1 being the highest) will become active for the product.

## Step 2: Define the Conditions

Most of the available conditions are based on existing attribute values. To apply the rule to all products, leave the conditions blank.

1. Scroll down and expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Conditions** section.

    The first condition appears by default, and states:

    If **ALL** of these conditions are **TRUE**:

   ![Catalog price rule - condition line 1]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-condition1.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Condition - Line 1_

    The statement has two bold links that you can click to display the selection of options for that part of the statement. You can create different conditions by changing the combination of these values. Do any of the following:

   - Click **ALL** and select `ALL` or `ANY`.
   - Click **TRUE** and select `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
   - Leave the condition unchanged to apply the rule to all products.

   You can create different conditions by changing the combination of these values. For this example, the default condition is used.

1. Click the **Add** (![Add icon]({% link images/images/btn-add-grn.png %})) icon at the beginning of the next line and select an option for the condition, such as a product attribute or combination.

   - In the list under **Product Attribute**, choose the attribute that you want to use as the basis of the condition. For this example, the condition is `Attribute Set`.

      ![Catalog price rule - condition line 2]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-condition2.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Condition Line 2, Part 1_

      {:.bs-callout-info}
      For an attribute to appear in the list, it must be configured to be used in promo rule conditions. To learn more, see [Product Attributes]({% link stores/attributes-product.md %}).

      The selected condition appears in the statement, followed by two more bold links. The options differ depending on the condition attribute you select. The statement now says:

        If **ALL** of these conditions are **TRUE**: <br/>Attribute Set **is** â€¦

   - Click **is** and choose the comparison operator that describes the condition to be met. These options may include an option for different comparisons, such as matching values, not including or including at least one of a value, and greater than, equal to, and less than a numerical amount. In this example, the options are `is` and `is not`.

   - Select or enter values for the condition. Depending on the condition, you may select products from a grid or list, enter a numerical value, and so on. For this example, click the (**...**) more link and choose the attribute set upon which the condition is based.

   ![Catalog price rule - condition line 2]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-condition3.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Condition Line 2, Part 3_

   The selected item appears in the statement to complete the condition.

   If **ALL** of these conditions are **TRUE**: <br/> Attribute Set **is Default**

1. To add another condition line to the statement, click the **Add** (![Add icon]({% link images/images/btn-add-grn.png %})) icon and choose one of the following:

   - `Conditions Combination`
   - `Product Attribute`

   Then, repeat the process until all desired conditions are complete.

   If at any time you want to delete part of the condition statement, click the **Delete** (![Delete icon]({% link images/images/btn-del-red.png %})) icon at the end of the line.

## Step 3: Define the Actions

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %})the **Actions** section and do the following:

   ![Catalog price rule - actions]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-actions.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Actions_

1. Under **Pricing Structure Rules**, set **Apply** to one of the following:

   |Apply as percentage of original|Discounts item by subtracting a percentage of the regular price. For example: Enter 10 in Discount Amount for a final price that is marked down 10% from the regular price.|
   |Apply as fixed amount|Discounts item by subtracting a fixed amount from the regular price. For example: Enter 10 in Discount Amount for a final price that is $10 less than the regular price.|
   |Adjust final price to this percentage|Adjusts the final price by a percentage of the regular price. For example: Enter 25 in Discount Amount for a final price that is marked down 75% from the regular price.|
   |Adjust final price to discount value|Sets the final price to a fixed, discounted amount. For example: Enter 20 in Discount Amount for a final price of $20.00.|

    {:.bs-callout-info}
    _Regular price_ refers to the base product price without any advanced pricing (special/tier/group) or promotional discounts. _Final price_ refers to the discounted price that appears in the shopping cart.

1. Enter the **Discount Amount**.

1. To stop processing other rules after this rule is applied, set **Discard Subsequent Rules** to `Yes`.

   {:.bs-callout-info}
   Setting this to `Yes` is a safeguard to prevent the system from applying multiple discounts (rules) to the same product.

{:.ee-only}
## Step 4: Add Related Dynamic Blocks

[Dynamic blocks]({% link cms/dynamic-blocks.md %}) that are associated with a catalog price rule appear in the storefront whenever the conditions are met. This is an optional step.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %})the **Related Dynamic Blocks** section.

1. Use the [search filters]({% link stores/admin-workspace.md %}) to locate the dynamic block(s) that you want to associate with the rule.

1. Select the checkbox in the first column to associate the dynamic block with the rule.

   ![Catalog price rule - related dynamic blocks]({% link images/images-ee/price-rule-catalog-related-dynamic-blocks.png %}){: .zoom}
   _Related Dynamic Blocks_

{:.ee-only}
## Step 5: Schedule the Rule

{:.bs-callout-info}
Setting the rule to active must be added as a scheduled update. To learn more, see [Scheduled Changes]({% link marketing/price-rule-catalog-scheduled-changes.md %}).

1. Click **Save and Continue Edit**.

    The Scheduled Changes timeline appears at the top of the page.

    ![Catalog price rules - scheduled changes]({% link images/images-ee/price-rule-scheduled-changes-new.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Scheduled Changes_

1. In the _Scheduled Changes_ box, click **View/Edit**.

    You can either edit the existing update or assign the catalog price rule to another campaign. The **Edit Existing Update** option is selected by default.

1. To schedule the rule, enter the **Start Date** and **End Date** that the price rule is to be active.

    You can either enter the dates or choose the dates from the **Calendar** (![Calendar icon]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %})).

    ![Catalog price rule - update schedule]({% link images/images-ee/price-rule-catalog-schedule-update.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Update Schedule_

1. Scroll to the _Rule Information_ section and set the **Status** to `active`.

## Step 6: Save and test the rule

1. When complete, save the rule.

   - {:.ce-only}Click <span class="btn">Save and Apply</span>.

      ![Catalog price rules - pricing structures]({% link images/images/price-rule-catalog-saved.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Pricing Structure Rules_{:.ce-only}

   - {:.ee-only}Click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

      The Rule Information page displays an updated timeline in the Scheduled Changes for the rule.

      ![Catalog price rules - scheduled changes]({% link images/images-ee/price-rule-scheduled-changes-updated.png %}){: .zoom}
      _Scheduled Changes_{:.ee-only}

1. Test the rule to make sure that it works correctly.

   Price rules are automatically processed with other system rules each night. When you create a new price rule, allow enough time for it to get into the system. Then, test the rule to make sure that it works correctly. As new rules are added, Magento recalculates the prices and the priorities accordingly.
