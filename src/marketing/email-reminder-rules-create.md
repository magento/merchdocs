Before setting up an email reminder rule, you must first set up a cart price rule to define the promotion that is being offered. Rule conditions that trigger an email reminder can be based on cart properties, wishlist properties, or both.

Email reminders might promote a cart price rule with, or without, a coupon. A cart price rule that defines an auto-generated coupon generates a random coupon code for each customer.

## Create an Email Reminder

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Communications_ > **Email Reminder Rules**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add New Rule</span>.

1. Complete the Rule Information, as follows:

    ![Email reminder rule]({% link marketing/assets/email-reminder-new.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Rule Information_

   - Enter a **Rule Name** to identify the rule internally.

   - Enter a brief **Description** of the rule.

   - To choose the **Cart Price Rule** promotion that this reminder is to advertise, click <span class="btn">Select Ruleâ€¦</span>, and select the rule.

        ![Cart rule - select]({% link marketing/assets/email-reminder-select-rule.png %}){: .zoom}
        _Select Cart Rule_

   - If you want the rule to go into effect immediately, set **Status** to `Active`.

   - To set up a date range for the rule to be active, enter the **From** and **To** dates.

        You can also choose the date from the Calendar ( ![Calendar icon]({% link assets/icon-calendar.png %}) ).

   - To send the reminder more than once, enter the number of days before the next email blast in the **Repeat Schedule** field.

1. In the panel on the left, choose **Conditions**. At least one condition must be defined for the rule. The process is similar to building a [catalog price rule.]({% link marketing/price-rules-catalog.md %})

   - Enter the **Rule Title for All Store Views**.

        This value can be incorporated into email templates by using the `promotion_name` variable.

   - In the **Titles and Descriptions Per Store View** section, enter the Rule Title and Description for the _Default Store View_. For multiple store views, enter the appropriate title and description for each.

        {:.bs-callout-info}
        The description can be incorporated into email templates by using the promotion_description variable.
