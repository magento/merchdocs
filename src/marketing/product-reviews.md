Commerce includes a native [product reviews]({% link marketing/magento-product-reviews.md %}) capability that you can manage from the Admin. You can also use an extension from the Commerce Marketplace to use a hosted review management system.

<div class="bs-callout-info" markdown="1">
Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source releases 2.4.0 through 2.4.3 included the Yotpo vendor-developed extension. Starting with the 2.4.4 release, this extension is no longer bundled with the core release and must be installed and updated from the Commerce Marketplace. The Marketplace also provides access to current documentation provided by the extension developer.

If you have the bundled extension enabled and configured, you must update your composer.json file as part of the 2.4.4 upgrade process and to manage extension updates going forward. See [Upgrade modules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/upgrade-guide/modules/upgrade.html) in the _Upgrade Guide_ for more information.
