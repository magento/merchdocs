title: Product Reviews
---

Product reviews help to build a sense of community, and are considered more credible than any advertising money can buy. In fact, some search engines give sites with product reviews a higher ranking than those without. For those who find your site by searching for a specific product, a product review is essentially the landing page of your store. Product reviews help people find your store, keep them engaged, and often lead to sales.

Magento offers a few product review options:

- [Magento Product Reviews]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/magento-product-reviews.md %})
- [Yotpo Product Reviews]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link marketing/yotpo-reviews-intro.md %})
