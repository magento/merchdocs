title: Setting Up a Gift Registry
---

A gift registry can be created for any type of event, such as a wedding, birthday, anniversary, new baby, or any other special occasion. By default, Magento includes the following special events:

- Baby
- Birthday
- Wedding

When you create a new registry, it becomes an option in the list of gift registry types in the customer’s account.

You can use one of the three prepared gift registries, or create your own custom registry. Each gift registry type includes a number of attributes, which are the data entry fields that a customer completes to create a gift registry. The attributes provide additional information about the event, time and location, or any other information that is needed. Depending on the input type, some attributes have multiple options. For example, the `Wedding` gift registry type has the attribute `Role`, with the `Bride`, `Groom`, and `Partner` options. To learn more about attributes and input types, see [Attributes]({% link stores/attributes.md %}).

## Use a Prepared Gift Registry

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Other Settings_ > **Gift Registry**.

    The birthday, wedding, and baby registries are ready for customers to use from their accounts.

1. Make sure to complete the [email template]({% link marketing/email-template-configuration.md %}) configuration, so they reflect your brand.

## Create a Custom Gift Registry

1. On the Admin sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Other Settings_ > **Gift Registry**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add Gift Registry Type</span>.

1. Under **General Information**, complete the following:

    - Enter a unique **Code** to identify the gift registry internally. The code must begin with a lowercase letter. The rest of the code can be any combination of lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and underscore (_).

    - In the **Label** field, enter a name for the gift registry, as you want it to appear in the store. This label will be an option in the list of gift registry types that are available to the customer.

    - In the **Sort Order** field, enter a number to determine the order that this gift registry appears when listed with other types.

    - To activate the gift registry, set **Is Listed** to `Yes`.

    _New Gift Registry Attribute_

1. For each attribute, do the following:

    - Assign a unique **Code** to identify the attribute internally. The code can be up to fifteen characters in length, and must begin with a lowercase letter. The rest of the code can include lowercase letters(a-z), numbers (0-9) and the underscore (_) character to separate words.

    - Choose the **Input Type** to be used for data entry. You can use one of the custom or static types.

    - Some input types have additional properties. For example, the Event Location has additional properties to make the event searchable, and included in your store’s public list of gift registries. If the input type has multiple options, click <span class="btn">Add New Option</span>. Then complete the following information for each option:

      - Set **Attribute Group** to the section in the gift registry where you want the attribute to appear.

      - In the **Label** field, enter a name to identify the data entry field.in the registry.

      - If the customer is required to make a selection or enter a value in the field, set **Is Required** to `Yes`.

      - In the **Sort Order** field, enter a number to determine the sequence in which this gift registry appears when listed with other gift registries that might be available in the store.

1. To add another option, click <span class="btn">Add New Option</span>.
