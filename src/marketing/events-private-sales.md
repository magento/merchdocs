Private sales and other catalog events are a great way to leverage your existing customer base to generate buzz and new leads, or to offload surplus inventory. You can create limited-time sales, limit sales to specific members, or create a stand-alone private sale page. You can also define invitations and event details. Increase brand loyalty and generate a buzz by giving your best customers the VIP treatment. Offer exclusive access to Member Only sales or private sales to increase brand loyalty. You can also use these sales to liquidate excess merchandise. Customer Groups are extremely useful in setting up these types of Members Only and VIP sales.
