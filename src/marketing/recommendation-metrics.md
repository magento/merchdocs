To analyze how well your recommendations are performing, Adobe Commerce collects and displays the following metrics on the Product Recommendations dashboard:

- **Impressions** - Number of times a Recommendation unit is loaded and rendered on a page. Note that the recommendation can be rendered on a page but not viewed by the shopper; for example, a Recommendation unit can be loaded “below the fold” of the browser’s viewport. In this case, the rendered unit would be counted as an impression, but a view would only be counted if the user scrolled the unit into view.

- **Viewable Impressions** - Number of Recommendation unit impressions that register at least one view.

- **Views** - Number of times a Recommendation unit appears in the viewport of the shopper's browser. This event can fire multiple times on a page.

- **Clicks** - Number of times a shopper clicks an item in a Recommendation unit.

- **Viewability %** - Percentage of Recommendation unit impressions that register a view.

- **Click-through rate (CTR) %** - Percentage of Recommendation unit impressions that register a click.

- **Viewable Click-through Rate (vCTR) %** - Percentage of Recommendation unit viewable impressions that register a click.

- **Revenue** - Revenue driven by a Recommendation. Revenue is calculated by the total value of items that were clicked on in a Recommendation unit and ultimately purchased.

- **Lifetime Revenue** - Lifetime revenue driven by a Recommendation. Lifetime revenue is calculated by the total revenue generated for a Recommendation unit from the time it was created.
