Products in your catalog can be promoted on other pages by defining the nature of the relationship between the products. The options available are:

Related Products
:  [Related Products]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-related-products.md %}) are meant to be purchased in addition to the item the customer is viewing. They complement, enhance, or add optional features to the product.

Up-sells
:  [Up-sell products]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-up-sells.md %}) are items that are similar, but are perhaps of a higher-quality, more popular, or have a better profit margin than the item the customer is considering.

Cross-sells
:  [Cross-sell products]({% link catalog/settings-advanced-cross-sells.md %}) are offered on the shopping cart page as last-minute purchases before the checkout process begins.

{:.ee-only}Related Product Rules
:  [Related product rules]({% link marketing/product-related-rules.md %}) give you the ability to target the selection of products that are presented to customers as related products, up-sells, and cross-sells.
