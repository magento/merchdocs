title: Creating Events

Each event is associated with a category from your catalog, and only one event can be associated with any given category at a time. To display a list of upcoming events in your store, you must also set up a [Catalog Events Carousel]({% link cms/widget-event-carousel.md -%}) widget.

![Events list]({% link images/images-ee/category-events.png %}){: .zoom}
_Manage Catalog Events_

## Create an Event

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Private Sales_ > **Events**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Add Catalog Event</span>.

1. In the category tree, choose the category that you want to associate with the event.

    Because each category can have only one event at a time, any categories that already have an event are disabled.

    ![New event - category tree]({% link images/images-ee/catalog-events-category-tree.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Select Category_

1. In the **Catalog Event Information** section, do the following:

    ![Catalog event information]({% link images/images-ee/catalog-event-information.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Catalog Event Information_

   - For the **Start Date** of the event, use the calendar (![Calendar icon]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %})) to choose the date. Then, use the **Hour** and **Minute** sliders to set the time the event begins.

   - For the **End Date** of the event, use the calendar (![]({% link images/images/btn-calendar.png %})) to choose the date. Then, use the **Hour** and **Minute** sliders to set the time the event ends.

   - To upload an **Image** for the event widget, click <span class="btn">Choose File</span>. Then, select the image file from your directory.

   - In the **Sort Order** field, enter a number to indicate the sequence in which this event appears when listed with other events.

   - Select the checkbox of each page where you want to display the countdown ticker:

      - Category Page
      - Product Page

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.
