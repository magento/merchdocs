title: CMS Page Rewrites
---

Before you begin, make sure that you understand exactly what the redirect is to accomplish. Think in terms of _target_ / _source_ or _redirect to_ / _redirect from_. Although people might still navigate to the former page from search engines or outdated links, the redirect causes your store to switch to the new target.

_Add URL Rewrite_

## Step 1. Plan the Rewrite

To avoid mistakes, write down the URL key of the _redirect to_ page and _redirect from_ page.

If you are not sure, open each page in your store, and copy the path from the address bar of your browser.

**CMS Page Path**

|Redirect to:|new-page|
|Redirect from:|old-page|

## Step 2. Create the Rewrite

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _SEO & Search_ > **URL Rewrites**.

1. Before you proceed, do the following to verify that the request path is available.

    - In the search filter at the top of the **Request Path** column, enter the URL key of the page that is to be redirected and click <span class="btn">Search</span>.

    - If there are multiple redirect records for the page, find the one that matches the applicable store view and open it in edit mode.

    - In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Delete</span>. When prompted, click <span class="btn">OK</span> to confirm.

1. When you return to the URL Rewrites page, click <span class="btn">Add URL Rewrite</span>.

1. Set **Create URL Rewrite** to `for CMS page`.

1. Find your new target page in the grid, and open in edit mode.

    ![Add URL rewrite - for CMS page]({% link images/images/url-rewrite-cms-page-add.png %}){: .zoom}
    _Custom URL Rewrite_

1. Under URL Rewrite Information, do the following:

    - If you have multiple store views, select the **Store** where the rewrite applies.

    - In the **Request Path** field, enter the URL key of the original page that the customer requests. This is the _redirect from_ page.

        {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
        The Request Path must be unique for the specified store. If there is already a redirect that uses the same Request Path, you will receive an error when you try to save the redirect. The previous redirect must be deleted before you can create a new one.

    - Set **Redirect** to one of the following:

        - `Temporary (302)`
        - `Permanent (301)`

    - For your reference, enter a brief description of the rewrite.

    _Custom URL Rewrite_

1. Before saving the redirect, review the following:

    - The link in the upper-left corner displays the name of the target page.
    - The Request Path contains the path for the original _redirect from_ page.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

    The new rewrite appears in the grid at the top of the list.

    _Saved URL Rewrite_

## Step 3. Test the Result

1. Go to the home page of your store.

1. Do one of the following:

    - Navigate to the original "redirect from" page.
    - In the address bar of the browser, enter the name of the original "redirect from" page immediately after the store URL. Then, press **Enter**.

    The new target page appears instead of the original page request.
