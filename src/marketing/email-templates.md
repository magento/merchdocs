Email templates define the layout, content, and formatting of automated messages sent from your store. They are called transactional emails because each one is associated with a specific type of transaction, or event.

Commerce includes a set of responsive email templates that are triggered by a variety of events that take place during the operation of your store. Each template is optimized for any screen size, and can be viewed from the desktop, as well as on tablets and mobile devices. You will find a variety of prepared email templates related to customer activities, sales, product alerts, admin actions, and system messages that you can [customize]({% link marketing/email-template-custom.md -%}) to reflect your brand.

Commerce emails can be rendered by HTML and plain text email clients. There might be some variation between clients in the way email are rendered.
