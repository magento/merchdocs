Each template is optimized for any screen size, and can be viewed from the desktop, as well as on tablets and mobile devices. You will find a variety of prepared email templates related to customer activities, sales, product alerts, admin actions, and system messages that you can [customize]({% link marketing/email-template-custom.md -%}) to reflect your brand.
