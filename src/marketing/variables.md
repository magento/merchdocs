Variables are pieces of information that can be created once and used in multiple places. Your store includes a large number of predefined variables that can be easily used to personalize [email]({% link marketing/email-templates.md -%}) and [newsletter]({% link marketing/newsletter-template.md -%}) templates, as well as other types of [content]({% link cms/content-elements.md -%}). You can also create custom variables to incorporate information that is specific to your needs.

- [Predefined Variables]({% link marketing/variables-predefined.md -%})
- [Custom Variables]({% link marketing/variables-custom.md -%})
