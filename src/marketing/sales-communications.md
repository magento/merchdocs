In addition to the email messages related to a sale, your store generates invoices, packing slips, and credit memos in both HTML and PDF formats. Before your store goes live, make sure to update these documents with your logo and store address. You can customize the address format and include additional information for reference.

- [Credit Memos]({% link sales/credit-memos.md %})
