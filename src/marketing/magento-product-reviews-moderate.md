To ensure that reviews are appropriate for public display your store, a submitted Magento product review must be approved before it can be displayed. A submitted review is in a `Pending` status until it is approved or rejected.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _User Content_ > **Pending Reviews**.

1. In the list, click a pending review to view the details and edit if necessary.

1. Change the **Status** according to your assessment:

   - To approve a pending review, select `Approved`.
   - To reject a review, select `Not Approved`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Review</span>.
