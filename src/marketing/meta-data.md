title: Meta Data
---

Your store is loaded with places where you can enter keyword-rich meta data to improve the way search engines index your site. While setting up your store, you might enter preliminary meta data, with the intention of finishing it later. Over time, you can fine-tune the meta data to target the buying patterns and preferences of your customers.

## Meta Title

The meta title appears in the title bar and tab of your browser, and search results listings. The meta title should be unique to the page, and less than seventy characters in length.

## Meta Keywords

Although some search engines ignore meta keywords, others continue to use them. The current best practice is to incorporate high-value keywords in the meta title and meta description.

## Meta Description

Meta descriptions provide a brief overview of the page for search results listings. Ideally, a meta description should be between 150-160 characters in length, although the field will accept up to 255 characters.

## Canonical Meta Tag

The [canonical meta tag]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/meta-canonical.md -%}) tells search engines which page to index when multiple URLs have identical or very similar content.

## Rich Snippets

Rich snippets provide detailed information for search results listings and other applications. By default, structured data markup that is based on the [schema.org][1] standard is added to your store’s product template. As a result, more information is available for search engines to include as “rich snippets” in product listings.
