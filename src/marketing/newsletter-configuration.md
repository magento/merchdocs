title: Configuring Newsletters
---

The first step in creating newsletters is to configure the newsletter settings for your site. You can require customers to click a confirmation link that is sent by email to confirm the subscription. This double opt-in, method requires customers to confirm twice that they want to receive your newsletter, and reduces the possibility that it might be considered to be spam.

## Configure Subscription Options

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Customers** and choose **Newsletter**.

1. If necessary, expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Subscription Options** section. Then, do the following:

    ![Customers configuration - newsletter subscriptions]({% link images/images/config-customers-newsletter-subscription-options.png %}){: .zoom}
    [_Subscription Options_]({% link configuration/customers.md -%})

    - Confirm the email template and sender of the each of the following email messages that are sent to subscribers:

        - Success email
        - Confirmation email
        - Unsubscribe email

    - To use the double opt-in process to confirm subscriptions, set **Need to Confirm** to `Yes`.

    - To allow people who do not have an account with your store to subscribe to the newsletter, set **Allow Guest Subscription** to `Yes`.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
