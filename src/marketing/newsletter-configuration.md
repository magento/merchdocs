title: Configuring Newsletters
---

The first step in creating newsletters is to configure the newsletter settings for your site. You can require customers to click a confirmation link that is sent by email to confirm the subscription. This double opt-in, method requires customers to confirm twice that they want to receive your newsletter, and reduces the possibility that it might be considered to be spam.

## To configure subscription options

1. On the Admin sidebar, tap **Stores**. Then under **Settings**, choose **Configuration**.

1. In the panel on the left under **Customers**, choose **Newsletter**.

1. If necessary, expand ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link images/images/btn-expand.png -%}) the **Subscription Options** section. Then, do the following:

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link images/images/config-customers-newsletter-subscription-options.png -%}){: .zoom}
    [Subscription Options]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link configuration/customers.md -%})

    * Confirm the email template and sender of the each of the following email messages that are sent to subscribers:

        * Success email
        * Confirmation email
        * Unsubscribe email

    * To use the double opt-in process to confirm subscriptions, set **Need to Confirm** to “Yes".

    * To allow people who do not have an account with your store to subscribe to the newsletter, set **Allow Guest Subscription** to “Yes".

1. When complete, tap <span class="btn">Save Config</span>.
