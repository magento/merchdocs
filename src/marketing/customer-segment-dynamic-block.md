A [dynamic block]({% link cms/dynamic-blocks.md %}) can target a specific [customer segment]({% link marketing/customer-segments.md %}), and be incorporated into a [cart price rule]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart.md %}). Because customer segments are dynamic, the price rule can adjust to changes in customer activity.
