title: Managing Subscribers
---

As a best practice you should manage your subscription list on a regular basis, and make sure to process any requests to unsubscribe. In some jurisdictions, it is required by law that requests to unsubscribe are processed within a specific period of time.

You can easily manage your subscribers using a simple list of active subscriptions. When a customer submits an unsubscribe request, you can simply apply an _Unsubscribe_ action to one or more selected subscriptions.

In single-site setups with multiple store views, a customer account subscription can be associated with a specific store view.

In multi-store and multi-site setups with a global [customer account scope]({% link customers/account-scope.md %}), a customer account can be subscribed to newsletters for multiple sites/stores. In this case, you may want to edit the customer account to manage a group of subscriptions or cancel a subscription for a specific site/store to honor a request.

If you want to use a third-party service to send newsletters, you can export your subscription list as a CSV or XML file.

1. Find the customer in the grid and click **Edit** in the _Action_ column.
