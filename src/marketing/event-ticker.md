The ticker block displays a countdown ticker for open events, with the start and end date for upcoming events. If an event has closed, the ticker shows the starting and ending dates.

If the Category Page ticker is enabled for an event, the ticker block appears at the top of the category listing. If the Product Page ticker is enabled, the ticker block also appears at the top of the product page of any product that is associated with the category.

The Event Ticker can be enabled when you are [Creating Events]({% link marketing/event-create.md %}).
