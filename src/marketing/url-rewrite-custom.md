title: Custom URL Rewrites
---

A custom rewrite can be used to manage miscellaneous redirects, such as redirecting a page from your store to an external website. For example, you might have two Magento websites, each with their own domain. You can use a custom redirect to reroute requests for a product, category, or page to the other website. Unlike other redirect types, the target of a custom redirect is not chosen from a list of existing pages in your store.

Before you begin, make sure that you understand exactly what the redirect is to accomplish. Think in terms of _target_ / _source_ or _redirect to_ / _redirect from_. Although people might still navigate to the former page from search engines or outdated links, the redirect causes your store to switch to the new target.

_Add URL Rewrite_

## Step 1. Plan the Rewrite

To avoid mistakes, write down the URL of the _redirect to_ page and the URL key of the _redirect from_ page.

If you are not sure, open each page, and copy the URL from the address bar of your browser.

**Custom Path**

Redirect to:

    http://www.different-website.com/page.html

Redirect from:

    cms-page
    category.html
    category/subcategory.html
    product.html
    category/product.html

## Step 2. Create the Rewrite

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _SEO & Search_ > **URL Rewrites**.

1. Before you proceed, do the following to verify that the request path is available:

    - In the search filter at the top of the **Request Path** column, enter the URL key of the page that is to be redirected and click <span class="btn">Search</span>.

    - If there are multiple redirect records for the page, find the one that matches the applicable store view and open it in edit mode.

    - In the upper-right corner, click <span class="btn">Delete</span>. When prompted, click <span class="btn">OK</span> to confirm.

1. When you return to the URL Rewrites page, click <span class="btn">Add URL Rewrite</span>.

1. Set **Create URL Rewrite** to `Custom`.

1. Under URL Rewrite Information, do the following:

    - If you have multiple store views, select the **Store** where the rewrite applies.

    - In the **Request Path** field, enter the URL key and path—if applicable—of the product, category, or CMS page that is to be redirected.

        {: .bs-callout .bs-callout-info}
        The Request Path must be unique for the specified store. If there is already a redirect that uses the same Request Path, you will receive an error when you try to save the redirect. The previous redirect must be deleted before you can create a new one.

    - In the **Target Path** field, enter the URL of the destination. If the target is located on another website, enter the fully qualified URL.

    - Set **Redirect** to one of the following:

        - `Temporary (302)`
        - `Permanent (301)`

    - For your reference, enter a brief description of the rewrite.

1. Before saving the redirect, review the following:

    - The Request Path contains the URL key or path of the original _redirect from_ page.
    - The Target Path contains the URL of the _redirect to_ page.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Save</span>.

    The new rewrite appears in the grid at the top of the list.

## Step 3. Test the Result

1. Go to the home page of your store.

1. Do one of the following:

    - Navigate to the original _redirect from_ page.
    - In the address bar of the browser, enter the name of the original _redirect from_ page immediately after the store URL and press **Enter**.

    The new target page appears instead of the original page request.
