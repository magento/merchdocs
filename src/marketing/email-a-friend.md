title: Email a Friend
---

The Email link makes it easy for your customers to share links to products with their friends. In the Magento demo store, the Email link appears as an envelope icon. The message template can be customized for your voice and brand. To prevent spamming, you can limit the number of recipients for each email, and the number of products that can be shared over a one-hour period.

## Configure Email to a Friend

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Catalog** and choose **Email to a Friend**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector]({% link images/images/btn-expand.png %}) the **Email Templates** section and set the options:

    ![Catalog configuration - email templates]({% link images/images/config-catalog-email-to-a-friend-email-templates.png %}){: .zoom}
    [_Email Templates_]({% link configuration/catalog/email-to-a-friend.md %})

    To change the default setting of any field, clear the **Use system value** checkbox to make the field editable.

    - Set **Enabled** to `Yes`.

    - Set **Select Email Template** to the template you want to use as the basis of the messages.

    - If you want to require that only registered customers can send email to friends, set **Allow for Guests** to `No`.

    - In the **Max Recipients** field, enter the maximum number of friends who can be on the distribution list for a single message.

    - In the **Max Products Sent in 1 Hour** field, enter the maximum number of products that can be shared by a single user with friends over a one-hour time period.

    - Set **Limit Sending By** to one of the following methods to identify the sender of emails:

        | IP Address | (Recommended) Identifies the sender by the IP address of the computer that is used to send the emails. |
        | Cookie (unsafe) | Identifies the sender by browser cookie. This method is less effective because the sender can delete the cookie to bypass the limit. |
