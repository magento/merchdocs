The purpose of an email reminder is encourage people who have visited your store to take advantage of a promotion and make a purchase. Email reminders can be automatically sent to customers when a specific set of conditions is met. For example, you might send a reminder to customers who have added something to their cart or wishlist, but have not yet made a purchase. You can use email reminders to encourage customers to return to your store, and include a [coupon code]({% link marketing/price-rules-cart-coupon.md -%}) as an incentive. Coupon codes can be automatically generated for each batch of email reminders, to give you control over the offers that are associated with each batch.

Email reminders can be triggered after a certain number of days have passed since a cart was abandoned, or for any other condition you want to define, such as total cart value, quantity, items in cart, and so on.
